"Who are you?" Tim asked. "Why do you have so much lumber?"
"None of your business!" the man said. "This is my lumber and you can't touch it! Go away or I'll call the police!"
Tim and Sam were scared. They dropped the lumber and ran back to the path. They wondered who the man was and why he was so mean. He was a mysterious man who did not like to share.
They decided to go home and tell their mom what they saw. Maybe she would know more about the man and his lumber. They hoped he would not come after them. They also hoped he would yield some of his lumber to other people who needed it.
Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play in the garden. One day, they saw a big pile of wood near the fence. They wanted to build a house with the wood, but they did not ask their mom.
They took some wood and started to stack it on the grass. They used a hammer and nails to make the wood stick together. They were having fun, but they were also very naughty.
"Look, Ben, our house is almost done!" Lily said.
"Yes, Lily, it is very nice. But we need a door and a window," Ben said.
They looked around and saw a big piece of wood leaning on the fence. It had a hole in the middle. It looked like a door with a window.
"Let's use that one, Lily. It is perfect for our house," Ben said.
They ran to the fence and tried to pull the wood. But it was too heavy and too big. They could not move it.
They heard a loud voice behind them. It was their dad. He was angry.
"What are you doing, Lily and Ben? That is not your wood. That is the wood for the new shed. You are not supposed to touch it. You could hurt yourself with the hammer and nails. And you made a mess on the grass. You are very naughty. Go to your room right now!" he said.
Lily and Ben felt scared and sorry. They dropped the hammer and nails and ran to their room. They knew they did something bad. They wished they had asked their mom first.
They sat on their bed and hugged each other. They did not want their dad to be mad at them. They wanted him to love them.
They closed their eyes and folded their hands. They prayed to God.
"Dear God, please forgive us for being naughty. We did not mean to make dad angry. We just wanted to have fun. Please help us to be good and listen to our mom and dad. Please make dad happy and love us again. Thank you, God. Amen," they prayed.
They opened their eyes and saw their mom standing at the door. She had a smile on her face.
"Your dad is not angry anymore. He knows you are sorry. He loves you very much. He wants to talk to you and hug you. Come on, let's go to him," she said.
Lily and Ben jumped off the bed and ran to their mom. They hugged her and said, "We love you, mom. We are sorry for being naughty."
They followed their mom to the garden, where their dad was waiting for them. He hugged them and said, "I love you, Lily and Ben. I am sorry for being loud. I was worried about you. You have to be careful with the wood and the tools. They are not toys. They are for building the new shed. Do you want to help me with that?"
Lily and Ben nodded and said, "Yes, dad. We want to help you. We are sorry for taking your wood. We will ask you next time."
They smiled and kissed their dad. They were happy again. They thanked God for answering their prayer. They learned their lesson. They decided to be good and not naughty.
Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play in the park with their toys. One day, Lily brought a new toy to the park. It was a shiny car that made noises. Ben wanted to play with it, but Lily said no. She said it was her toy and she did not want to share.
Ben felt sad and angry. He thought Lily was not nice. He waited until Lily was not looking and took the car from her bag. He put it in his pocket and ran away. He thought he was clever and happy.
But when he got home, he felt bad. He looked at the car and did not want to play with it. He knew he did something wrong. He knew he hurt Lily's feelings. He wished he did not take the car. He wished he said sorry to Lily. He regretted being mean to his friend.
The next day, he went to the park with the car. He saw Lily sitting on a bench. She looked sad and lonely. She did not have any toys. Ben felt sorry for her. He walked up to her and took the car out of his pocket. He said, "Lily, I am sorry. I took your car yesterday. It was not nice of me. I want to give it back to you. Can we be friends again?"
Lily looked at Ben and the car. She was surprised and happy. She said, "Ben, thank you. I am sorry too. I should have shared my car with you. It is more fun to play together. Yes, we can be friends again."
They hugged and smiled. They played with the car and their other toys. They learned to be kind and share. They did not regret being friends.
Anna and Ben are going to the airport with Mom and Dad. They are very happy because they are going to see Grandma and Grandpa. They have big bags with clothes and toys.
At the airport, there are many people and planes. Anna and Ben see a big sign that says "Welcome". They also see signs with pictures of animals and places. They like to look at the signs and say what they are.
Mom and Dad have tickets for the plane. They show the tickets to a lady who smiles and gives them stickers. Anna and Ben put the stickers on their shirts. They feel very special.
They follow the signs to the gate where their plane is. They see a big plane with a blue and white tail. They hear a man say their plane is ready to go. They walk to the door of the plane and say "bye" to the lady.
They find their seats on the plane and buckle their belts. They look out the window and see the airport get smaller and smaller. They wave to the signs and the people and the planes. They are very excited to see Grandma and Grandpa soon.
Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They have a cube. The cube is rough and big. They can roll it and throw it.
One day, they see a dog in the park. The dog is brown and furry. It looks friendly. Lily and Ben want to pet the dog. They jog to the dog with the cube.
But the dog does not like the cube. The dog thinks the cube is a toy. The dog wants to play with the cube. The dog barks and jumps. It grabs the cube with its teeth.
"Hey, that's our cube!" Lily says. She tries to pull the cube from the dog.
"No, it's mine!" the dog says. It growls and shakes the cube.
Ben is scared. He does not want to fight with the dog. He wants to run away. He says to Lily, "Let's go, Lily. The dog can have the cube. We can find another one."
But Lily is angry. She likes the cube. She does not want to give it to the dog. She says to Ben, "No, Ben. The cube is ours. We have to get it back."
Lily and Ben tug on the cube. The dog tugs on the cube. They make a lot of noise. They do not see the man who owns the dog.
The man hears the noise. He sees the children and the dog. He runs to them. He says, "Stop, stop! What are you doing?"
He takes the cube from the dog. He says to Lily and Ben, "I'm sorry, kids. This is my dog. He likes to play with things. He did not mean to take your cube."
He says to the dog, "Bad dog! You have to share. You have to be nice."
He gives the cube back to Lily and Ben. He says, "Here you go. This is your cube. You can play with it. But be careful. The cube is rough. It can hurt you or the dog."
Lily and Ben say, "Thank you, sir. We're sorry, too. We did not know the dog was yours. We just wanted to pet him."
They say to the dog, "We're sorry, dog. You can play with us. But you have to share. You have to be nice."
The dog wags its tail. It licks Lily and Ben. It says, "Woof, woof! I'm sorry, kids. I just wanted to play with you. I like the cube. But I can share. I can be nice."
Lily and Ben smile. They pet the dog. They say, "It's okay, dog. We like you. You can play with us. And you can play with the cube. But we have to share. We have to be nice."
They all play together in the park. They roll and throw the cube. They jog and run. They have fun. They are friends.
Ben and Lily were playing in the park with their toy cars. They liked to make noises like the cars on the road. Ben had a red car that was shiny and fast. Lily had a blue car that was big and loud. She had a horn on her car that she could press to make a beep.
"Beep beep!" Lily said, as she drove her car towards Ben's car. "Move out of the way, slow car!"
Ben did not like that. He wanted to play nicely with Lily, but she was being mean. He tried to drive his car away, but Lily followed him. She pressed her horn again and again.
"Beep beep! Beep beep! Beep beep!" Lily said, laughing.
"Stop it, Lily!" Ben said, feeling angry and sad. "You are hurting my ears! And you are not being a good friend!"
Lily did not stop. She thought it was funny to annoy Ben. She drove her car closer and closer to Ben's car, until they crashed. Ben's car fell on the ground and broke. The wheel came off and the paint scratched.
"Uh oh!" Lily said, looking at Ben's car. "I'm sorry, Ben. I did not mean to break your car."
Ben picked up his car and saw the damage. He felt tears in his eyes. He loved his car. It was a gift from his grandpa. It was very expensive and special.
"It's okay, Lily," Ben said, trying to be brave. "But you have to be more careful. And you have to be nicer. You can't just beep your horn all the time. It's rude and noisy."
Lily felt bad. She realized she had been a bad friend. She wanted to make Ben happy again.
"I'm sorry, Ben," Lily said, giving him a hug. "Can we still be friends?"
Ben smiled and hugged her back. He was a kind boy. He forgave Lily.
"Of course we can, Lily," Ben said. "But can you please stop beeping your horn so much?"
Lily nodded. She learned her lesson. She decided to share her horn with Ben. They played together with their cars, taking turns to beep the horn. They had fun and were friends again.
Lily liked to follow her big brother Tom everywhere. She wanted to do what he did and learn from him. Tom was good at many things, like drawing, reading and playing games. He had a big brain and many original ideas.
One day, Tom decided to make a rocket out of cardboard boxes, tape and paint. He told Lily to help him and follow his instructions. Lily was happy to help, but she also wanted to add her own touches. She found some stickers, glitter and feathers and stuck them on the rocket. She thought it looked more fun and pretty.
Tom was not happy when he saw what Lily had done. He said she ruined his rocket and made it look silly. He said she should follow him, not do her own thing. He said she had a small brain and no original ideas.
Lily felt sad and hurt. She did not want to make Tom angry, but she also liked to be creative. She ran away to her room and cried. She wished Tom would like her rocket and her ideas.
Mom heard Lily crying and came to see what was wrong. She saw the rocket and smiled. She said it was a wonderful rocket and she loved how Lily decorated it. She said Lily had a big brain and many original ideas. She said she was proud of Lily for being herself and not just following others.
Lily felt better and hugged Mom. She said she was sorry for upsetting Tom, but she also liked her rocket. Mom said it was okay to follow Tom sometimes, but it was also good to be original sometimes. She said Tom would calm down and see that Lily's rocket was not ruined, but different.
She asked Lily if she wanted to play with the rocket with her. Lily said yes and smiled. She hoped Tom would join them later and see that they could all have fun with their big brains and original ideas.
Tom and Sam are brothers. They like to play in their room. They have many toys and books and games. But they do not share well. They always fight over who gets what.
One day, Mom says, "Boys, I have a surprise for you. We are going to spend the day at the zoo. You can see the animals and have fun. But you have to be good and not fight. Can you do that?"
Tom and Sam nod and smile. They love the zoo. They put on their coats and shoes and follow Mom to the car. They are very excited.
At the zoo, they see lions and tigers and bears. They see monkeys and elephants and giraffes. They see birds and fish and snakes. They have a lot of fun. They also see a panda. Mom says, "Look, boys, a panda. It is very rare. You do not see it often. It is special."
Tom and Sam look at the panda. It is black and white and fluffy. It eats bamboo and rolls on the ground. It is very cute. Tom and Sam both want to touch it. They run to the fence and reach out their hands.
"Stop!" Mom says. "You cannot touch the panda. It is not a toy. It is a wild animal. It can bite you. You have to be careful and respectful. You have to share the space with the panda and the other people. Can you do that?"
Tom and Sam nod and say sorry. They realize they were wrong. They do not want to hurt the panda or make Mom angry. They step back and watch the panda from a distance. They also let other children see the panda. They learn to share and be kind.
Mom smiles and hugs them. She says, "Good boys. I am proud of you. You are learning and growing. You are special too. Just like the panda."
Tim and Jen like to play in the park. They have a big sack with toys and snacks. They run and jump and slide and swing. They have fun.
But the sun is very hot. It makes them sweat and thirsty. They look for a place to rest. They see a big tree with green leaves. It makes a lot of shade under it. They run to the tree and sit down.
They open the sack and take out some juice and cookies. They drink and eat and talk. They hear a loud noise. They look up and see a big bird. It is a crow. It has black feathers and a yellow beak. It is on a branch above them.
The crow sees the sack. It wants the juice and cookies. It flies down and tries to grab the sack. Tim and Jen scream and hold the sack. They do not want to share with the crow. The crow is angry and noisy. It pecks and flaps and caws.
Tim and Jen are scared and sad. They do not like the crow. They want it to go away. They look for help. They see a man with a dog. The man is a park ranger. The dog is a friendly. They bark and run to the tree. They scare the crow. The crow flies away.
Tim and Jen are happy and relieved. They thank the man and the dog. They give them some juice and cookies. They share and smile. They finish their rest and pack their sack. They are ready to play again. They have fun.
Sara and Ben like to travel with their mom and dad. They go to many places and see many things. One day, they travel to a big forest. They see many trees and animals. They are happy.
But in the forest, there is a witch. She is not kind. She is mean. She likes to make trouble for people. She sees Sara and Ben and wants to catch them. She makes a loud noise and scares them.
"Who are you?" Sara asks.
"I am the witch of the forest. And you are my lunch!" the witch says.
Sara and Ben are scared. They run away from the witch. They look for their mom and dad. But they are lost. They do not know where to go.
They see a small house. It is made of candy and cake. It smells good. They are hungry. They go to the house. They knock on the door.
"Hello?" a voice says.
They open the door. They see a lady. She is not a witch. She is kind. She smiles at them.
"Who are you?" Ben asks.
"I am the fairy of the forest. And you are my guests!" the lady says.
Sara and Ben are happy. They go inside the house. The lady gives them food and drink. She tells them stories. She helps them find their mom and dad.
They thank the lady and hug her. They say goodbye. They travel back to their mom and dad. They tell them about the witch and the fairy. They are safe and happy. The end.
Lily liked to design boats. She used paper, glue, and crayons to make them. She wanted to sail them on the pond. But she had a problem. Her brother Ben was very nosy. He always wanted to see what she was doing. He would take her boats and play with them. He would break them or lose them. Lily was sad and angry.
One day, Lily had an idea. She decided to make a special boat for Ben. She used paper, glue, and crayons to make it. But she also added something else. She put some pepper inside the boat. She hoped that Ben would sneeze when he opened it. She thought that would teach him a lesson.
She left the boat on the table and went to the pond. She sailed her other boats and had fun. She waited for Ben to come and find the boat. She wanted to see his face when he sneezed.
But Ben did not come. He was busy with something else. He did not see the boat on the table. He did not touch it or open it. He did not sneeze.
Lily came back from the pond. She saw the boat on the table. She was curious. She wondered if Ben had seen it. She picked it up and opened it. She saw the pepper. She sneezed. She sneezed again and again. She felt silly and sorry. She realized that her idea was not very nice. She wished she had not done it.
She learned a lesson. She learned that being nosy is not good. But she also learned that being mean is not good either. She decided to be more kind and respectful to her brother. She hoped that he would do the same to her. She thought that maybe they could design boats together and have more fun.
Tom and Sam are brothers. They like to play in the park. They see a big slide. They want to go on the slide.
"Me first!" Tom shouts. He runs to the slide. He climbs up the ladder. He sits on the slide.
"Wait for me!" Sam shouts. He runs after Tom. He climbs up the ladder. He tries to sit behind Tom.
But Tom is too big. He takes up all the space. Sam cannot fit on the slide. He pushes Tom. Tom pushes back.
"Stop it!" Tom shouts. "You are too heavy. You make the slide slow."
"No, you stop it!" Sam shouts. "You are too hairy. You tickle my nose."
They start to fight. They pull each other's hair. They kick each other's legs. They make a lot of noise.
A lady sees them. She is the park keeper. She has a whistle. She blows the whistle. She walks to the slide.
"Hey, you two!" she shouts. "What are you doing? You are not supposed to fight on the slide. You are supposed to slide down and have fun. Now get off the slide and say sorry to each other."
Tom and Sam stop fighting. They look at the lady. They feel ashamed. They slide down the slide. They say sorry to each other. They hug.
The lady smiles. She says, "That's better. Now go and play nicely. And remember, sharing is caring."
Tom and Sam nod. They say, "Thank you, lady." They run to the swings. They take turns. They have fun. They are happy.
Lily and Ben were playing in the living room. They liked to pretend they were in a castle, and they used the curtain as a door. The curtain was rough and red, and it made a noise when they moved it.
"Knock, knock," Ben said. "Who is there?"
"It is me, the princess," Lily said. "Can I come in?"
"Yes, you can," Ben said. He moved the curtain and let Lily in. "Welcome to my castle. Do you want some tea?"
"Yes, please," Lily said. She sat on the couch and Ben gave her a cup. The cup was plastic and had flowers on it. They pretended to drink tea and talk.
They enjoyed playing in the castle. They laughed and told stories. They did not hear their mom calling them for lunch. She came to the living room and saw them behind the curtain.
"Hello, my little royals," she said. "Are you having fun?"
"Yes, mom," Lily and Ben said. "We are in a castle."
"That's wonderful," mom said. "But it is time to eat. Come on, let's go to the kitchen."
Lily and Ben put down their cups and followed mom. They moved the curtain and said goodbye to the castle. They were hungry and happy. They liked to play with the curtain.
Lily and Sam were friends who liked to play in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run around. One day, they saw a new bench in the park. It was big and shiny and had a sign that said "For everyone".
"Let's sit on the bench!" Lily said. "It looks fun!"
"OK!" Sam said. They ran to the bench and climbed on it. They pretended it was a boat, a car and a rocket.
But then, a big boy came to the bench. He was mean and angry. He said "This is my bench! Go away!"
Lily and Sam were scared. They said "No, the sign says for everyone. You have to share!"
The big boy did not like that. He pushed Lily and Sam off the bench. They fell to the ground and hurt their knees and elbows. They cried and cried.
The big boy laughed and said "Ha ha, now the bench is mine! You can't play here!"
Lily and Sam were very sad. They ran to their moms and told them what happened. Their moms hugged them and said "We're sorry, that was not nice. Let's go home and put some band-aids on your hurts."
Lily and Sam said goodbye to the park and the bench. They did not want to play there anymore. They wished the big boy would learn to be nice and include others.
Sara and Tom are playing with a big puzzle. The puzzle has many pieces of different colors and shapes. Sara likes the blue pieces and Tom likes the green pieces. They try to fit the pieces together to make a picture of a farm.
"Look, Sara, I found a piece of the cow!" Tom says, holding a white and black piece. "Where does it go?"
Sara looks at the puzzle and points to a spot near the bottom. "It goes here, Tom. See, this is the cow's leg."
Tom nods and puts the piece in the right place. He smiles and looks for another piece.
Sara picks up a pale yellow piece. She thinks it is part of the sun. She looks at the top of the puzzle, but she does not see where it fits. She feels confused.
"Tom, can you help me?" Sara asks. "I don't know where this piece goes. Is it part of the sun?"
Tom looks at the piece and shakes his head. "No, Sara, that is not part of the sun. That is part of the chicken. See, this is the chicken's beak."
He points to a small orange piece that is next to a brown piece. He takes the pale yellow piece from Sara and puts it next to the orange piece. He shows Sara how the pieces make a chicken's head.
"Oh, I see!" Sara says. "Thank you, Tom. You are very smart."
Tom blushes and says, "You're welcome, Sara. You are very nice."
They hug and continue to play with the puzzle. They have fun and learn new things. They are happy friends.
Tom and Lily were twins. They liked to play with their toys and make things. One day, they decided to make a display of their toys for their mom and dad. They used a big box, some paper, and some glue.
They put their toys on the paper and glued them to the box. They had cars, dolls, animals, and blocks. They made a road, a house, a farm, and a tower. They were very proud of their display. They wanted to show it to their mom and dad.
They called their mom and dad to come and see their display. Mom and dad came and looked at the box. They smiled and clapped. They said, "Wow, what a wonderful display! You are very creative and clever, Tom and Lily!"
Tom and Lily were happy. They hugged their mom and dad. They said, "Thank you, mom and dad! We love you!"
Mom and dad said, "We love you too, Tom and Lily! You are our special and unusual youth. You always make us happy!"
Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys. But sometimes they fight over them. One day, they both want the same truck. They pull and pull, but the truck does not move. It has a knot in the string.
"Let go, it is mine!" Anna says.
"No, it is mine!" Ben says.
They pull harder and harder. The knot gets tighter and tighter. Then, snap! The string breaks and the truck splits in two. Anna and Ben fall back and cry.
Mom hears the noise and comes to see. She sees the broken truck and the sad twins. She hugs them and says, "I'm sorry, my loves. The truck is not available anymore. But I have an idea. Why don't you share these blocks? You can build anything you want with them. And you can help each other and have fun."
Anna and Ben wipe their tears and nod. They say, "Okay, Mom. We will share the blocks. And we will not fight anymore." They hug Mom and say, "Thank you, Mom. We love you."
Mom smiles and says, "I love you too, my loves. Now, let's go and build something amazing." She helps them pick up the blocks and they go to the living room. They start to build a castle, a bridge, and a car. They use their imagination and their teamwork. They are happy and proud of their creations. They forget about the truck and the knot. They only remember their love and their fun.
Sara and Ben were adventurous kids. They liked to play outside and explore new places. One day, they found a big hole in the ground. They wondered what was inside.
"Maybe there is treasure in there," Sara said. "Let's go and see."
They climbed down the hole. It was dark and cold. They used a flashlight to look around. They saw shiny things and old things. They were excited.
"Look, Ben, a necklace!" Sara said. She picked up a silver chain with a blue stone. "It's so pretty. I want to keep it."
But then they heard a loud roar. A big bear came out of a corner. It was angry. It saw the kids and the necklace. It wanted the necklace. It growled and ran towards them.
"Freeze!" Ben said. He was scared. He hoped the bear would stop. But the bear did not stop. It came closer and closer.
Sara and Ben did not freeze. They ran. They ran back to the hole. They climbed up as fast as they could. They left the necklace behind. They did not care about the treasure anymore. They only wanted to be safe.
They reached the top of the hole. They saw the sun and the grass. They felt the warm air. They were happy. They hugged each other.
"That was too scary," Sara said. "Let's never go there again."
"OK," Ben said. "Let's go home and have some cookies."
They walked away from the hole. They did not look back. They learned a lesson. Sometimes, being adventurous can be dangerous.
Lily and Sam were friends. They liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big truck. The truck had a lot of popcorn. The popcorn smelled good.
"Can we have some popcorn?" Lily asked the truck man.
"Sure, you can have some popcorn. But you have to help me first. The popcorn bags are very heavy. Can you carry them to the table?" the truck man said.
Lily and Sam nodded. They wanted to help. They each took a popcorn bag. The popcorn bags were very heavy. They walked slowly to the table. They put the popcorn bags on the table.
"Thank you, Lily and Sam. You are very strong and kind. Here, you can have some popcorn. Enjoy!" the truck man said. He gave them each a small bowl of popcorn.
Lily and Sam smiled. They thanked the truck man. They sat on the bench and ate the popcorn. The popcorn was yummy. They shared the popcorn with some birds. They had a fun day.
Ben is a boy who likes to play with his dog, Max. Max is a lab, a big and friendly dog. Ben and Max like to run and jump and fetch in the park. They are happy together.
One day, Ben and Max go to the park with Ben's mom. Ben's mom works in a lab, a place where she does science. She tells Ben and Max to stay near her while she talks to some other people who work in the lab. Ben and Max listen, but they are bored.
They see a ball on the grass. It looks like a fun ball. Ben and Max run to the ball and start to play with it. They do not see that the ball belongs to another boy, who is angry. The boy runs after Ben and Max and yells at them. He tries to take the ball from Max, but Max growls and bites the boy's hand. The boy cries and tells his dad.
Ben's mom hears the noise and runs to Ben and Max. She sees the boy's dad, who is mad. He says that Max is a bad dog and that he should go away. He says that the ball is his son's and that Ben and Max stole it. He says that he will call the animal control to take Max away.
Ben is scared and sad. He loves Max and does not want to lose him. He hugs Max and tells him that he is a good dog. He tells the boy's dad that he is sorry and that he did not know that the ball was not theirs. He says that Max was only trying to protect him and that he did not mean to hurt the boy. He asks the boy's dad to please not call the animal control.
Ben's mom is worried and sorry too. She talks to the boy's dad and tries to calm him down. She says that she works in the lab and that Max is a safe and healthy dog. She says that she can check the boy's hand and make sure that he is okay. She says that she can give the boy a new ball and that Ben and Max can share their toys with him. She says that she hopes that they can be friends and not fight.
The boy's dad listens to Ben's mom and sees that she is nice and smart. He sees that Ben and Max are sorry and scared. He sees that the boy's hand is not very bad and that he is not crying anymore. He thinks that maybe he was too angry and that he should not be mean. He says that he is sorry too and that he will not call the animal control. He says that he will take the boy to the lab and let Ben's mom check his hand. He says that he will accept the new ball and that he will let the boy play with Ben and Max.
Ben and Max are happy and relieved. They thank the boy's dad and say that they are sorry again. They go to the lab with Ben's mom and the boy and his dad. They see that the lab is a cool place with many machines and things. They see that the boy's hand is fine and that he is not mad anymore. They see that the boy likes the new ball and that he wants to play with them. They become friends and play together. They share their toys and have fun.
Ben and Max kiss each other and their mom. They are glad that everything is okay. They are glad that they have a new friend. They are glad that they are safe and loved. They are glad that they are a lab and a boy.

"On the stage?" Mia and Ben say.
"Yes, on the stage. I am a musician too. I play the guitar. I have a show here in the park. But I need some help. Do you want to help me?" he says.
Mia and Ben look at each other. They are excited. They want to help. They want to be on the stage.
"Yes, please!" they say.
The man smiles. He takes them to the stage. He gives them a microphone and a speaker. He tells them to wait for his signal. He goes to his guitar and starts to play. The people in the park gather around. They hear the music. They are curious.

"Can we have ice cream, Mom? Please, please, please!" they say.
Mom smiles and says, "OK, but only one cone each. What flavor do you want?"
Sara wants chocolate and Ben wants vanilla. The ice cream man scoops the ice cream and puts it on the cones. He gives Sara and Ben their cones and says, "Here you go, kids. Enjoy your ice cream."
Sara and Ben say, "Thank you, ice cream man!" and lick their cones. They are very happy and yummy.
But then, a big black dog comes to the park. He sees the ice cream and he wants some too. He runs to Sara and Ben and barks loudly. He tries to grab their cones with his mouth.
"Hey, stop it, dog! This is our ice cream!" Sara and Ben shout.
Mom sees the dog and says, "Shoo, shoo, go away, dog! You can't have their ice cream. It's not good for you."
The dog does not listen. He jumps on Sara and Ben and knocks them down. Their cones fall to the ground and the ice cream melts.
Sara and Ben cry. They are sad and mad. The dog licks the ice cream and wags his tail. He is happy and full.
The ice cream man sees what happened and says, "Oh, no, I'm sorry, kids. That was a bad dog. He shouldn't have done that. Here, I'll give you new cones. What flavor do you want?"
Sara and Ben wipe their tears and say, "Thank you, ice cream man. You are very nice. We want the same flavors as before."
The ice cream man scoops the ice cream and puts it on the cones. He gives Sara and Ben their cones and says, "Here you go, kids. Enjoy your ice cream. And be careful of the dog. He is very big and he weighs a lot. He can hurt you if he jumps on you."
Sara and Ben say, "Thank you, ice cream man. We will be careful. And we will share our ice cream with you if you want."
The ice cream man smiles and says, "No, thank you, kids. I have enough ice cream. But I appreciate your offer. You are very sweet."
Sara and Ben lick their cones and smile. They are happy and yummy again. They hug Mom and say, "We love you, Mom. And we love ice cream."
Mom hugs them back and says, "I love you too, Sara and Ben. And I love ice cream too. But not as much as I love you."
Lila and Tom were at the zoo with their mom. They saw many animals, but their favorite was the seal. The seal was big and gray, and had a thick fur. It liked to swim and splash in the water.
"Look, mom, the seal is waving at us!" Lila said, pointing at the seal that lifted its flipper.
"Maybe it wants to say hello," mom said. "Do you want to say hello back?"
"Yes, yes!" Lila and Tom said, and waved their hands at the seal.
The seal seemed happy, and made a loud noise. It sounded like "arf, arf, arf!"
"What is it saying, mom?" Tom asked.
"I don't know, maybe it's saying thank you for being nice," mom said. "Or maybe it's saying that it values your friendship."
"What does value mean, mom?" Lila asked.
"It means that you care about something or someone very much, and that you think they are important and special," mom said.
"Oh, I see. I value you, mom, and I value Tom, and I value the seal too," Lila said.
"I value you too, Lila, and I value mom, and I value the seal too," Tom said.
"I value you both, Lila and Tom, and I value the seal too," mom said.
They all smiled and hugged each other, and then waved at the seal again. The seal waved back, and arfed some more. They felt happy and warm, and knew that they had made a new friend.
Anna loved music. She liked to sing and dance and play with her toy piano. She had a music box that her grandma gave her. It had a ballerina inside that spun around when she opened it. It played a pretty song that made Anna happy.
One day, Anna was playing with her music box in her room. She wanted to show it to her friend Lily, who was coming over later. She put it on her bed and went to get her coat. But when she came back, she saw something terrible. Her dog Spot had jumped on her bed and knocked her music box to the floor. It was broken. The ballerina was gone and the song was silent. Anna felt very sad and angry. She yelled at Spot and ran to her mom.
"Mom, mom, Spot broke my music box! It was my favorite thing! It was from grandma! It's ruined!" Anna cried.
"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. Let me see it. Maybe we can fix it." Mom said. She hugged Anna and took the music box. She looked at it carefully. She saw that the ballerina was not missing, but stuck inside. She gently pried it out and put it back in place. She wound up the music box and opened it. The ballerina spun around and the song played again. Anna's eyes lit up. She smiled and clapped her hands.
"Mom, you rescued my music box! You're the best! Thank you, thank you!" Anna said.
"You're welcome, sweetie. I'm glad it's working again. It's a very special music box. I'm sure grandma would want you to enjoy it and share it with your friends." Mom said.
Anna hugged her mom and her music box. She was not sad or angry anymore. She was happy and grateful. She decided to forgive Spot, who looked worried and sorry. She petted him and gave him a treat. She said sorry for yelling at him. She knew he didn't mean to break her music box. He was just curious and playful. She loved him anyway.
Soon, Lily arrived and Anna showed her the music box. They both admired the ballerina and listened to the song. They sang and danced and played with the toy piano. They had a lot of fun with music. Anna was glad she had her music box, her mom, her dog and her friend. She felt very lucky.
Lily loved to dance. She danced every day in her room, in the garden, and at school. She wanted to be a dancer when she grew up. She had a lot of dresses and shoes for dancing.
One day, she saw a new dress in the shop window. It was pink and shiny and had a big bow. Lily wanted it very much. She asked her mom to buy it for her. Her mom said no. She said they had no money for a new dress. Lily was angry. She cried and screamed and kicked. She demanded the dress.
Her mom was sad and tired. She tried to calm Lily down. She said they could go to the library and read a book about dancers. She said they could make a dress from old clothes. She said they could watch a dance show on TV. She said she loved Lily very much.
But Lily did not listen. She did not want anything else. She only wanted the dress. She ran away from her mom and into the street. She did not look where she was going. She did not see the big car. The car hit her hard. Lily fell down and did not get up.
Her mom ran to her and held her. She cried and screamed and called for help. But it was too late. Lily was gone. She never danced again.
Lily loves her dog Max. He is big and brown and soft. He likes to play with Lily and make her laugh. Sometimes he barks at the birds or the mailman, but he is a good dog.
One day, Lily and Max go to the park with Mom. There are many other dogs and people there. Lily sees a slide and wants to try it. She asks Mom if she can go. Mom says yes, but she tells Lily to release Max's leash. She says Max can run and play with the other dogs.
Lily does what Mom says. She releases Max's leash and runs to the slide. She climbs up the steps and sits on the top. She feels excited and scared. She looks for Max, but she can't see him. There are too many dogs and people. She feels alone and sad.
She slides down and runs to Mom. She tells Mom she wants Max. She says she is sorry she released his leash. She says she misses him. Mom hugs Lily and tells her it's okay. She says Max is fine. She says they will find him soon.
They walk around the park and call Max's name. Lily sees a big tree with a bench under it. She sees Max lying on the bench. He looks comfortable and happy. He sees Lily and Mom and wags his tail. He jumps off the bench and runs to them. He licks Lily's face and makes her laugh. Lily hugs Max and tells him she loves him. She says she is glad they found him. Mom smiles and says they are a good team. They go back to the car and drive home. Lily and Max are comfortable and happy. They are best friends.
Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play in the park with their mom and dad. One day, they see a big slide. Anna wants to go first. She runs to the slide and climbs the steps. Ben follows her.
"Wait for me, Anna!" Ben says.
"No, I go first!" Anna says. She slides down very fast. She laughs and runs back to the steps.
Ben is sad. He wants to slide too. He tries to climb the steps, but Anna pushes him. He falls down and hurts his knee. He cries.
"Anna, that's not nice!" Mom says. She runs to Ben and hugs him. She puts a band-aid on his knee. "Are you okay, Ben?"
Ben nods. He still feels sad. Mom gives him a kiss.
"Anna, you need to say sorry to Ben," Dad says. He looks at Anna. She looks down. She knows she was bad.
"I'm sorry, Ben," Anna says. She goes to Ben and hugs him. "Can we be friends again?"
Ben smiles. He hugs Anna back. "Yes, we can. But can I slide too?"
"Okay, you can slide too," Anna says. "But let's take turns."
They go to the slide and take turns. They have fun. Mom and Dad watch them and smile.
After a while, they are hungry. Mom and Dad take them to a nearby cafe. They order some sandwiches and juice. They are very tasty.
"Thank you, Mom and Dad, for the tasty food," Anna and Ben say.
"You're welcome, Anna and Ben," Mom and Dad say. "We're proud of you for sharing and saying sorry."
Anna and Ben are happy. They love their mom and dad. They love each other. They are a happy family.
Tom likes to go to the park with his mom. He likes to see the ducks and the flowers and the big trees. But his favorite thing is to feed the fish in the pond. The fish are green and shiny and they make funny noises when they eat.
One day, Tom and his mom go to the park with a bag of bread. Tom runs to the pond and throws some bread in the water. He sees the green fish come up and nibble the bread. He laughs and claps his hands. He wants to feed them more.
But his mom says, "Wait, Tom. You have to share the bread with the ducks too. They are hungry as well." She reminds him that the ducks are his friends and they like bread too. She gives him some more bread and shows him how to toss it to the ducks. The ducks quack and flap their wings and swim to the bread.
Tom watches the ducks and the fish eat the bread. He thinks they are both nice and funny. He says, "Mom, I like the ducks and the fish. Can we come back tomorrow and feed them again?" His mom smiles and hugs him. She says, "Yes, Tom. We can come back tomorrow and feed them again. They will be happy to see you." Tom is happy too. He loves the park and the ducks and the fish.
Sara and Ben are twins. They like to help Mom in the kitchen. Mom is very happy when they do. She says they are clever and good.
One day, Mom asks Sara and Ben to put the dirty plates in the dishwasher. Sara and Ben say yes and run to the sink. They take turns to pick up the plates and put them in the dishwasher. They are careful not to break them.
But then, Sara sees a plate with a piece of cake on it. She loves cake. She thinks Mom will not notice if she eats it. She takes the plate and hides behind the table. She starts to eat the cake.
Ben sees what Sara is doing. He is angry. He says, "Sara, that is not fair! You have to share the cake with me. Give me some, or I will tell Mom!"
Sara does not want to share. She says, "No, Ben, this is my cake. Go away!"
Ben does not go away. He goes to Sara and tries to grab the plate. Sara holds it tight. They start to pull and push. They shout and cry.
Mom hears the noise. She comes to the kitchen. She sees Sara and Ben fighting over the plate. She sees the cake on the floor. She is not happy. She says, "Sara, Ben, what are you doing? You are not supposed to eat the cake. You are supposed to put the plates in the dishwasher. And you are not supposed to fight. You are supposed to be nice to each other. You are not clever and good. You are naughty and bad."
Sara and Ben feel sorry. They say, "We are sorry, Mom. We were greedy and mean. We will not do it again. We will put the plates in the dishwasher. We will be nice to each other."
Mom says, "That is good. But you also have to say sorry to each other. And you have to pinch your ears as a punishment."
Sara and Ben say sorry to each other. They pinch their ears. They say, "Ouch, that hurts!"
Mom says, "Yes, it hurts. But it also teaches you a lesson. Next time, you will not eat the cake. You will share it. And you will not fight. You will help each other. Then you will be clever and good again."
Sara and Ben nod. They hug Mom. They hug each other. They finish putting the plates in the dishwasher. They smile. They are clever and good again.
Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park. They see a big flag on a pole. The flag is red and white and blue. It moves in the wind.
"Look, Mia, the flag is flexible!" Tom says. "It can bend and twist and wave."
"I want to touch the flag," Mia says. "It looks soft and pretty."
They run to the pole. But the pole is too high. They cannot reach the flag.
"Let's lie on the grass and look at the flag," Tom says. "Maybe we can see the shapes on it."
They lie on the grass and look up. They see stars and stripes on the flag.
"What are those shapes, Tom?" Mia asks.
"Those are stars and stripes," Tom says. "They are symbols of our country. My dad told me."
"What is a country?" Mia asks.
"A country is a big place where we live," Tom says. "There are many countries in the world. They have different flags and different names."
"Wow, that's interesting," Mia says. "I like our flag. It is flexible and beautiful."
They smile and watch the flag. They feel happy and proud. They are friends and they love their country.
Ben and Mia are playing in the garden. They have a big bucket of water and some cups. They like to fill the cups and pour the water on the flowers and the grass.
"Look, Mia, this flower is very pretty. It has many colors," Ben says, holding a cup of water.
"Yes, it is. Let me see," Mia says, walking towards Ben.
But Ben is naughty. He splashes the water on Mia's face and laughs. "Ha ha, you are wet!"
Mia is not happy. She feels the water on her eyes and nose and mouth. She is cold and angry. She grabs another cup of water and throws it at Ben. "No, you are wet!"
They start a water fight. They run and chase and splash each other. They have fun, but they also soak their clothes and shoes and hair.
Suddenly, they hear a loud sound. It is the bell. It is time to go inside. Mom is calling them for lunch.
"Come on, Ben and Mia, lunch is ready. What are you doing?" Mom says, looking at them.
They stop and look at each other. They are dripping and dirty and hungry. They smile sheepishly.
"We are playing with water, Mom. It is interesting," they say together.
Mom shakes her head and laughs. "You are silly. Come on, let's go and dry you up. And then you can tell me all about your interesting game."
Ben and Mia were playing on the beach. They liked to dig in the sand and look for shells. They saw a crab walking sideways near the water. It had big claws and a hard shell.
"Look, a crab!" Ben said. "Let's catch it!"
Mia was scared of the crab. She did not want to touch it. She said, "No, Ben, it might pinch us!"
Ben did not listen. He ran after the crab with a bucket. He tried to put the bucket over the crab, but the crab was too fast. It reversed and ran away from Ben.
"Come back, crab!" Ben shouted. He chased the crab again, but the crab was smarter. It hid under a rock and waited for Ben to go away.
Mia watched Ben and the crab. She thought they were both restless. She wished they would stop and sit with her. She said, "Ben, come here. Let's make a sandcastle instead."
Ben heard Mia. He looked at the crab and the bucket. He was tired of running. He said, "Okay, Mia. Let's make a sandcastle. Maybe the crab will come out later."
Ben and Mia went back to their spot. They used their shovels and pails to make a big sandcastle. They decorated it with shells and seaweed. They were happy and proud of their work.
The crab peeked out from under the rock. It saw the sandcastle. It thought it was pretty. It crawled out and walked towards it. It wanted to see it closer. It did not see Ben and Mia. They were behind the sandcastle. They saw the crab. They smiled and whispered, "Shh, look, the crab is back!"
One day, Tom and Sam went to play in the woods. They liked to run, jump and climb on the trees. They saw a big hole in the ground. It was a cave.
"Let's go inside and see what is there," Tom said.
"OK, but be careful. It is dark and scary," Sam said.
They took a stick and a flashlight and walked into the cave. They saw many rocks and bats. They heard a loud roar. It was a bear!
"Run, run, run!" Tom shouted.
They ran back to the entrance, but the bear was faster. It blocked their way. They were trapped.
"What do we do now?" Sam asked.
"We have to solve this problem. We have to make the bear go away," Tom said.
He looked around and saw a big rock. He had an idea.
"Hey, bear, look at this!" he yelled.
He threw the rock at the bear's head. The bear was angry. It turned around and chased the rock.
"Now, let's go!" Tom said.
They ran out of the cave and did not look back. They were safe.
They hugged each other and smiled.
"We did it! We solved the problem!" Sam said.
"Yes, we did. We are brave and smart!" Tom said.
They went back to their home and told their mom and dad what happened. They were proud of themselves.
They never went back to the cave again. They knew it was a dead place. They liked to play in the woods, but not in the cave.
Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play with their toys. They had many toys, but their favorite was a long rope that they could make into different shapes. Sometimes they made a snake, sometimes a bridge, sometimes a swing.
One day, they wanted to play with the rope, but they could not agree on what to make. Lily wanted to make a knot, because she liked how it looked. Ben wanted to make a loop, because he liked how it felt. They both pulled on the rope, trying to get their way.
"Let me make a knot!" Lily said.
"No, let me make a loop!" Ben said.
They pulled and pulled, until the rope was so tight that it hurt their hands. They also made a big mess in their room, with toys and clothes everywhere. They were not happy at all.
Their mom came in and saw the mess and the tight rope. She was not happy either. She asked them what they were doing, and why they were fighting. They told her that they wanted to play with the rope, but they could not agree on what to make.
Mom said, "You know, you can both play with the rope, and have fun, if you learn to share and take turns. You can make a knot, and then a loop, and then something else. You can also help each other, and learn from each other. That way, you can be kind and happy, and not hurt yourselves or make a mess."
Lily and Ben thought about what mom said. They realized that she was right. They said sorry to each other, and to mom. They untied the rope, and decided to make a knot first, and then a loop. They also cleaned up their room, and put their toys and clothes away.
They played with the rope, and had a lot of fun. They made many shapes, and laughed and hugged. They were glad that they learned to share and take turns, and to settle their problems with words, not with pulling. They also learned that the rope was more fun when it was long and loose, not short and tight.
Lily was sleepy. She wanted to go to bed, but she had to brush her teeth first. She went to the bathroom and saw her big brother, Tom, in front of the mirror. He was wearing a nice shirt and a tie.
"Tom, can you help me?" Lily asked. "I don't know how to brush my teeth."
"Sure, Lily, I can help you," Tom said. He smiled and put down his comb. He picked up Lily's toothbrush and toothpaste. He showed her how to squeeze a little bit of toothpaste on the brush and how to scrub her teeth gently.
"Like this, Lily. Up and down, and side to side. Don't forget the back teeth and the tongue," Tom said.
Lily followed Tom's instructions. She brushed her teeth until they were shiny and clean. She spat out the toothpaste and rinsed her mouth with water.
"Good job, Lily. You did it!" Tom said. He gave her a hug and a kiss. "Now, let's go to your room and tuck you in."
Lily nodded. She was very sleepy. She yawned and rubbed her eyes. She took Tom's hand and walked to her room. Tom helped her put on her pajamas and get into her bed. He pulled the blanket over her and tucked it under her chin.
"Good night, Lily. I love you," Tom said.
"Good night, Tom. I love you too," Lily said. She smiled and closed her eyes. She felt warm and cozy. She was happy that Tom helped her.
Tom turned off the light and left the room. He went back to the bathroom and finished fixing his tie. He was going to a party with his friends. He was excited, but he also felt proud of his little sister. He was happy that he helped her.
Lily and Ben were friends. They liked to play together in the park. One day, they saw a big house with a fence. The house had many windows and a door with a bell.
"Who lives there?" Lily asked.
"I don't know. Maybe someone rich," Ben said.
They walked closer to the fence. They saw a switch on the wall. It had a sign that said "Do not touch".
"What does it do?" Lily wondered.
"Let's find out," Ben said. He reached for the switch.
"No, don't!" Lily said. "The sign says no."
But Ben did not listen. He pushed the switch. Suddenly, the house made a loud noise. Lights flashed and music played. The door opened and a man came out. He looked angry.
"Who are you? What are you doing here?" he shouted.
Lily and Ben were scared. They ran away from the fence. They did not look back.
They ran to the park. They sat on a bench. They were out of breath.
"That was not fun," Lily said.
"No, it was not," Ben agreed.
They looked at each other. They smiled. They were still friends. They decided to play something else. Something safe and nice. They did not touch the switch again.
Lily was a good girl who liked to help her mom. She helped her mom serve food to the people who came to their house. She also helped her mom clean the dishes and the table. Lily was happy to serve others.
One day, Lily's mom gave her a medal. It was shiny and had a star on it. Lily's mom said, "This is for you, Lily. You are a star helper. You serve others with love and kindness. I am proud of you." Lily was very happy. She put the medal around her neck and showed it to everyone.
But not everyone was happy for Lily. Ben, who lived next door, was jealous. He wanted a medal too. He thought he was better than Lily. He said to Lily, "Your medal is ugly. You don't deserve it. You only serve others because you want to be popular. You are not a star. You are a fake." He tried to take the medal from Lily.
Lily was sad and angry. She said, "No, Ben. You are wrong. My medal is beautiful. I deserve it. I serve others because I care about them. I am not a fake. I am a star." She held on to her medal.
Ben and Lily started to fight. They pulled and pushed each other. They shouted and cried. Their moms heard them and came to see what was wrong. They saw Ben and Lily fighting over the medal. They were shocked and disappointed.
They separated Ben and Lily and took them to their houses. They said, "Ben, Lily, you should not fight. Fighting is bad. It hurts others and yourself. You should be sorry for what you did. You should say sorry to each other and be friends. You should share and respect each other. You should learn from Lily. She serves others with love and kindness. That is what makes her a star. That is what makes her medal shine." Ben and Lily felt ashamed. They said sorry to each other and hugged. They became friends. They learned to serve others with love and kindness. They both became stars.
Ben and Lily are twins. They like to eat cereal for breakfast. They have a big box of cereal with many colors and shapes. They call it rainbow cereal.
One morning, Ben and Lily wake up early. They are hungry and want to eat rainbow cereal. They go to the kitchen and find the box on the shelf. They try to reach it, but it is too high. They need a stool.
"Ben, can you get the stool?" Lily asks.
"OK, Lily, I will try," Ben says.
Ben goes to the corner and pulls the stool. It is heavy and makes a loud noise. Ben does not notice the noise. He is happy to get the stool.
But Mom and Dad notice the noise. They are sleeping in their room. They hear the loud noise and wake up. They wonder what is going on.
They get out of bed and go to the kitchen. They see Ben and Lily with the stool and the box of cereal. They look surprised and a little angry.
"Ben, Lily, what are you doing?" Mom asks.
"We want to eat rainbow cereal, Mom," Lily says.
"But it is too early, Ben," Dad says.
"We are hungry, Dad," Ben says.
Mom and Dad sigh. They are not happy, but they are not very mad. They love Ben and Lily. They decide to help them.
"OK, Ben, Lily, you can eat rainbow cereal, but only a little bit. And next time, please wait for us to wake up. Do you understand?" Mom says.
"Yes, Mom, we understand," Ben and Lily say.
They smile and hug Mom and Dad. They pour some cereal in their bowls and add some milk. They eat their rainbow cereal and enjoy it. They are happy and full. They say thank you to Mom and Dad.
Mom and Dad smile and hug them back. They are glad that Ben and Lily are good and polite. They make some coffee and toast for themselves. They sit with Ben and Lily and talk. They are a happy family.
Tim and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big slide. Tim wants to go on the slide, but Mia is scared.
"Come on, Mia, it is fun!" Tim says. "You can do it!"
Mia shakes her head. "No, Tim, it is too high. I will fall and hurt myself."
Tim smiles. "No, you will not. I will help you. I will go first, and then you can follow me. Trust me, Mia, you will succeed!"
Tim climbs up the stairs and slides down. He laughs and claps his hands. "See, Mia, it is easy! Your turn now!"
Mia looks at Tim. He is happy and brave. She is envious. She wants to be like him. She takes a deep breath and decides to try. She climbs up the stairs and slides down. She feels the wind in her hair and the sun on her face. She lands on the ground and smiles. She did it!
"Wow, Mia, you are amazing!" Tim says. "You are not scared anymore!"
Mia hugs Tim. "Thank you, Tim, for helping me. You are a good friend. I am proud of myself. I feel safe and happy!"
They both laugh and run to the slide again. They have fun and enjoy the day. They are both proud and happy. They are both good friends.
Tom and Sue were playing in the garden. They liked to dig and make mud pies. They found an old ashtray in the dirt. It was blue and round and had a picture of a fish on it.
"Look, I found a fish bowl!" Tom said. He filled the ashtray with water and put some grass and stones in it.
"No, it's not a fish bowl, it's an ashtray. My dad has one like that. He puts his smokes in it." Sue said. She took the ashtray from Tom and dumped the water out.
"Hey, give it back! I want to play with it!" Tom said. He grabbed the ashtray from Sue and ran away.
Sue chased him and tried to get it back. They ran around the garden and splashed in the puddles. They got very wet and dirty. The ashtray got soaked too.
"Stop, stop, you're making a mess!" Mom said. She came out of the house and saw them. She was not happy. She took the ashtray from them and threw it in the trash.
"That's not a toy, that's a nasty thing. You shouldn't play with it. And look at you, you're soaked and muddy. Come inside and get cleaned up." Mom said.
Tom and Sue followed Mom inside. They were sad and sorry. They liked the blue ashtray. They wanted to play with it more. But they knew they did something bad. They said sorry to Mom and hugged her. Mom forgave them and gave them a bath. She told them a story about a real fish bowl and a real fish. Tom and Sue liked the story. They forgot about the ashtray. They were happy again.
Tim and Mia love their pet dog, Max. Max is big and brown and has thick fur. He likes to run and play and bark. Sometimes he makes Tim and Mia laugh with his funny tricks.
One day, Tim and Mia's mom says, "We have a surprise for you. We are going to the park and we can take Max with us." Tim and Mia are very excited. They put on their coats and hats and shoes. They get Max's leash and his ball. They say, "Come on, Max, let's go!"
At the park, there are many other dogs and people. Max is happy to see them. He wags his tail and sniffs the air. He runs and jumps and chases his ball. Tim and Mia throw the ball for him and he brings it back. They say, "Good boy, Max, you are so smart and fast!"
But then, Max sees a squirrel. The squirrel is small and gray and has a long tail. It runs up a tree and makes a noise. Max is curious. He wants to catch the squirrel. He forgets about his ball and his leash. He runs after the squirrel and barks.
"Max, no, come back!" Tim and Mia shout. They try to catch him, but he is too fast. He follows the squirrel from one tree to another. He does not listen to Tim and Mia or their mom. He is too busy with the squirrel.
Tim and Mia are worried. They do not want to lose Max. They do not want him to get hurt. They hope he will come back soon. They love their pet dog, Max. He is big and brown and has thick fur. He likes to run and play and bark. Sometimes he makes them laugh with his funny tricks.
Tim and Sue were friends who liked to travel. They had a big map on the wall and they put stickers on the places they wanted to see. One day, they decided to go to the farm with their bikes. They packed some snacks and water and put on their helmets.
The farm was far away, but they enjoyed the ride. They saw cows, sheep, horses and chickens. They waved to the farmer and he waved back. He was a modest man who worked hard. He let them pet some of the animals and gave them some fresh milk.
Tim and Sue were having fun, but they did not notice the time. It was getting dark and they had to go back home. They thanked the farmer and got on their bikes. But they did not know the way. They got lost and scared. They tried to follow the road, but it was too dark and they could not see.
They heard a loud noise behind them. It was a big truck with bright lights. The driver did not see them either. He was going too fast and he had a whip in his hand. He was a mean man who liked to hurt animals. He saw Tim and Sue and he laughed. He used his whip to hit them and make them fall off their bikes.
Tim and Sue cried and screamed. They were hurt and bleeding. They wanted to go home, but they could not. The truck driver did not stop. He drove away and left them alone. Tim and Sue were very sad and afraid. They wished they never went to the farm. They wished they stayed home and played with their map.
Lily and Ben were friends who liked to play in the park. They liked to gather flowers and leaves and make art with them. They used napkins to glue their art on. They were very proud of their art and showed it to everyone. Everyone said their art was pretty and popular.
One day, a big boy came to the park. He saw Lily and Ben's art and wanted to have it. He said, "Give me your art, or I will break it." Lily and Ben were scared and said, "No, this is our art. We made it. Go away." The big boy got angry and said, "Fine, then I will break it." He grabbed their art and tore it apart. He threw the napkins and the flowers and the leaves on the ground. He laughed and ran away.
Lily and Ben were very sad and cried. They looked at their art and saw it was ruined. They could not make it again. They had no more napkins or glue. They felt like they had lost something very important. They hugged each other and wished the big boy would say sorry. But he never did. The end.
Tim and Mia like to play in the park. They like to swing, slide and run. One day, they see something new in the grass. It is long and thin and has scales. It is a snake!
Tim and Mia are curious. They want to touch the snake. They go closer and closer. The snake does not move. It is very still. Tim and Mia think it is sleeping.
Tim reaches out his hand. He wants to poke the snake. Mia says, "No, Tim, don't do that! The snake might bite you!" But Tim does not listen. He pokes the snake with his finger.
The snake wakes up. It is angry. It hisses and shows its teeth. It starts to coil around Tim's hand. Tim is scared. He screams and cries. Mia is scared too. She runs to get help.
A man hears Tim and Mia. He comes to the park. He sees the snake on Tim's hand. He is brave. He grabs the snake and pulls it off. He throws it away. The snake slithers away. It is not happy.
The man checks Tim's hand. He is lucky. The snake did not bite him. He only has a red mark. The man tells Tim and Mia, "You should never touch a snake. Snakes are dangerous. They can hurt you. You should stay away from them."
Tim and Mia nod. They say, "We are sorry. We did not know. Thank you for saving us." The man smiles. He says, "You are welcome. Be careful next time." He takes Tim and Mia to their mom. Their mom hugs them. She is glad they are safe.
Tim and Mia learn a lesson. They do not play with snakes anymore. They play with other things in the park. They play with balls, bikes and dolls. They have fun. They are happy.
Ria and Rob are twins. They like to play outside. One day, they see a big black bird on a tree. It is a raven.
"Look, Rob, a raven!" Ria says. "It is so black and shiny. I want to touch it."
"Me too," Rob says. "But it is too high. How can we reach it?"
Ria thinks. She sees a yellow ball near the tree. She has an idea.
"Let's try to throw the ball at the raven. Maybe it will come down," she says.
"OK, let's try," Rob says.
They take turns to throw the ball at the raven. But the raven is smart. It dodges the ball every time. It makes a loud noise. It sounds like it is laughing at them.
"Stop it, raven!" Ria says. "You are not nice. Come down and play with us."
The raven does not listen. It flies away to another tree. Ria and Rob are sad. They want to make friends with the raven.
"Maybe we should try something else," Rob says. "Maybe we should give the raven something it likes. What do ravens like?"
Ria thinks. She remembers a story her mom told her. It is about a raven and a fox. The raven has a cheese in its mouth. The fox wants the cheese. The fox flatters the raven. The raven opens its mouth to sing. The cheese falls down. The fox eats the cheese.
"I know!" Ria says. "Ravens like cheese. Let's find some cheese and give it to the raven. Maybe it will come down and share it with us."
"Good idea," Rob says. "Let's go to the kitchen and get some cheese."
They run to the kitchen. They find a slice of cheese in the fridge. They run back to the tree. They see the raven still on the branch.
"Hey, raven, look what we have!" Ria says. "We have cheese. Do you want some cheese?"
The raven looks at the cheese. It smells good. It feels hungry. It flies down to the ground. It lands near Ria and Rob.
"Thank you, raven, for coming down," Ria says. "Here, you can have some cheese. But can we touch you? You are so soft and pretty."
The raven nods. It takes a bite of the cheese. It lets Ria and Rob touch its feathers. It feels nice. It makes a soft noise. It sounds like it is happy.
Ria and Rob smile. They are happy too. They have made a new friend. They share the cheese with the raven. They play with the ball. They have fun. They are glad they tried to be nice to the raven.
Lily and Tom were best friends. They liked to play in the park in summer. They liked to slide, swing and run. They also liked to pretend they were lions. They would roar and chase each other.
One day, they saw a big dog in the park. It was black and furry. It had sharp teeth and a loud bark. Lily and Tom were not afraid. They thought they could scare the dog away. They ran towards the dog and roared like lions.
The dog did not like their roar. It did not think they were lions. It thought they were annoying. It growled and snapped at them. Lily and Tom were scared. They turned around and ran away. But the dog was faster. It caught Tom by his leg and bit him hard.
Lily screamed and ran to get help. She found a grown-up and told him what happened. The grown-up called an ambulance and the police. They came and took Tom to the hospital. They also took the dog away.
Lily was very sad. She wished she had been more thoughtful. She wished she had not roared at the dog. She wished she had stayed away from it. She hoped Tom would be okay. She hoped they could still be friends. She hoped they could still play in the park in summer. But she knew things would not be the same. She knew they had made a big mistake. She knew they had learned a hard lesson.
Lily liked to play dress-up with her dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite was Anna. Anna had a long blue dress and a shiny crown. Lily wanted to be like Anna and have a fancy dress and a crown too.
One day, Lily found a big box in her room. It had a note from her mom. The note said: "For my princess Lily. Have fun!" Lily opened the box and saw a beautiful dress and a crown inside. She was so happy! She put on the dress and the crown and looked in the mirror. She felt like a real princess.
She decided to show her mom her new outfit. She ran to the living room, where her mom was sitting on the couch with a fan. It was a hot day and the fan made the air cooler. Lily said: "Mom, look at me! I'm a princess!"
Her mom smiled and said: "You look wonderful, Lily! You are a very pretty princess!"
Lily hugged her mom and said: "Thank you, mom! You are the best!"
Then, something strange happened. A fairy appeared in front of them. She had wings and a wand and a sparkly dress. She said: "Hello, Lily and mom! I'm here to grant you a wish. You can wish for anything you want!"
Lily and her mom were surprised and amazed. They looked at each other and wondered what to wish for. Lily thought of her dolls, her dress, her crown, and her mom. She realized she had everything she needed. She said: "I don't need a wish, fairy. I'm happy with what I have. But thank you for coming!"
The fairy smiled and said: "You are very wise, Lily. You have a lot of love in your heart. I'm glad you are happy. I'll leave you a gift anyway. It's a magic fan. It can make you fly if you hold it and say the magic word. The magic word is 'fly'."
She gave Lily the fan and said: "Have fun, princess! And remember to be kind and grateful always!" Then, she disappeared.
Lily and her mom were amazed by the fairy and the fan. They thanked her and tried the fan. They held it and said "fly". They felt a breeze lift them up and they flew around the room. They laughed and had fun. They felt like they were in a fairy tale.
Sam and Tom were brothers who liked to play with their toy cars. They had many cars of different colors and sizes, but their favorite was a big red truck that could make loud noises and reverse. They took turns driving the truck around the living room, pretending to be firemen or builders or explorers.
One day, their mom baked a delicious apple pie for dessert. She put the pie on the table and told the boys, "The pie is ready, but it is very hot. Do not touch it until after dinner, okay?" Sam and Tom nodded and said, "Okay, mom." But they were very curious about the pie. It smelled so good and looked so yummy.
When their mom went to the kitchen to wash the dishes, Sam and Tom sneaked to the table. They wanted to have a little taste of the pie. Sam reached for the pie, but Tom stopped him. "No, Sam, we have to wait. Mom said it is hot. And it is not fair to eat it before dinner." Sam frowned and said, "But I want some now. Just a little bit. Mom will not know." He grabbed the pie and pulled it towards him.
But the pie was too heavy and slippery for Sam. He lost his balance and fell backwards, dragging the pie with him. The pie flew in the air and landed on the floor, upside down. The crust broke and the filling spilled everywhere. Sam and Tom gasped and stared at the mess. They heard their mom coming back from the kitchen.
"Oh no, what have you done?" their mom asked, shocked and angry. She saw the pie on the floor and the boys with guilty faces. She knew they had disobeyed her. She scolded them and made them clean up the mess. She said, "You should have listened to me. The pie was hot and ready, but you were greedy and impatient. Now you have wasted the pie and made a big mess. You will not have any dessert tonight, and you will have to share your red truck for a week."
Sam and Tom felt very sorry and ashamed. They apologized to their mom and helped her clean up. They learned their lesson. They realized that they should respect their mom and follow her rules. They also learned to be grateful for what they have and not to be greedy for what they want. They hugged their mom and thanked her for the pie. They promised to be good boys and to share their red truck. They hoped that their mom would bake another pie someday.
Lily liked to peek at things. She peeked at her mom when she cooked. She peeked at her dad when he read. She peeked at her cat when he slept. She liked to see what they were doing.
One day, Lily saw a mysterious box on the table. It was big and brown and had a ribbon on it. She wondered what was inside. She wanted to peek at it.
She waited until her mom and dad were busy. Then she tiptoed to the table. She reached for the box. She lifted the lid. She peeked inside.
She saw a lot of oat. It was white and fluffy and smelled good. She touched it with her hand. It was soft and warm. She smiled. She liked oat.
But then she heard a noise. It was a squeak. It came from the box. She looked closer. She saw a tiny nose. And two black eyes. And two long ears. It was a bunny!
Lily gasped. She was surprised. She was happy. She loved bunnies. She picked up the bunny. She hugged it. She said, "Hello, bunny. You are my new friend."
The bunny licked her cheek. It said, "Hello, Lily. You are my new friend, too."
Lily and the bunny laughed. They played with the oat. They had fun. They were happy.
Lily's mom and dad came to the table. They saw Lily and the bunny. They smiled. They said, "Surprise, Lily. This is your birthday present. We hope you like it."
Lily nodded. She said, "I love it. Thank you, mom and dad. This is the best birthday ever."
Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play outside in the park. They enjoy the different seasons. In spring, they see colorful flowers and birds. In summer, they splash in the water and eat ice cream. In fall, they jump in the leaves and pick apples. In winter, they make snowmen and slide on the ice.
One day, they go to the park in winter. They see a big hill with snow. They want to slide down the hill. Anna says, "Let's use this sled. It is red and shiny. It is fast and fun." Ben says, "No, let's use this board. It is blue and smooth. It is cool and easy." They both want to use their own thing. They do not want to share. They start to argue.
"Red sled is better!" Anna says.
"Blue board is better!" Ben says.
They pull and tug at their things. They get angry and sad. They do not play anymore. They sit on the snow and pout.
A dog comes to the park. He sees the red sled and the blue board. He thinks they are toys. He runs to them and grabs them with his mouth. He runs away with them. He is happy.
Anna and Ben see the dog. They see their things. They are shocked and scared. They run after the dog. They shout, "Stop! Come back! Give us our things!"
The dog does not listen. He runs faster and farther. He goes to another park. He drops the red sled and the blue board. He finds a ball. He plays with the ball.
Anna and Ben reach the other park. They see their things. They are relieved and glad. They run to them and hug them. They say, "We are sorry. We were silly. We should have shared. We are friends."
They look at each other and smile. They decide to try each other's thing. Anna slides on the blue board. Ben slides on the red sled. They have fun. They enjoy the winter. They are happy.
Anna loves to read books. She likes to look at the pictures and the words on the pages. She has many books in her room, but her favorite one is about a princess and a dragon.
One day, Anna wants to read her favorite book to her little brother, Ben. She finds the book on her shelf and sits on the floor with Ben. She opens the book and starts to read.
"Once upon a time, there was a princess who lived in a castle. She was very kind and brave, but she was also very stubborn. She always wanted to do things her way."
Ben listens to Anna for a while, but he gets bored. He does not like the princess. He likes the dragon. He wants to see the dragon. He grabs the book from Anna and flips the pages.
"Stop it, Ben!" Anna says. "You are ruining the book! You have to read it from the beginning!"
"No, I don't!" Ben says. "I want to see the dragon! The dragon is cool! The princess is boring!"
Anna and Ben start to fight over the book. They pull and tug and shout. The book rips in half. The pages fly everywhere. Anna and Ben stop fighting. They look at the book. They feel sad.
"I'm sorry, Anna," Ben says. "I didn't mean to rip your book."
"I'm sorry, too, Ben," Anna says. "I should have let you see the dragon."
They hug each other. They pick up the pages and try to put them back together. They decide to share the book and take turns reading. They learn that the princess and the dragon become friends at the end. They smile and say, "We love this book!"
Tim and Anna were playing in the park with their dog, Spot. They liked to run, jump, and slide on the grass and the swings. Spot liked to chase the birds and the squirrels.
"Look, Tim, there is a man with a whistle!" Anna said, pointing to a man in a blue shirt and a hat. He was blowing his whistle and waving his arms.
"What is he doing?" Tim asked, curious.
"He is a referee. He is in charge of the game. He tells the players when to start and stop and when they break the rules," Anna explained. She had learned about referees from her dad, who liked to watch soccer on TV.
"Can we watch the game?" Tim asked.
"Sure, let's go closer," Anna said. They held hands and walked towards the field, where two teams of boys and girls were kicking a ball.
They sat on the grass and watched the game. Spot lay down next to them and wagged his tail. The game was fast and fun. The players ran, passed, and shot the ball. Sometimes they scored, and sometimes they missed. The referee blew his whistle and shouted things like "offside", "foul", and "penalty".
"Wow, this is exciting!" Tim said.
"I like the red team. They are good," Anna said.
"I like the yellow team. They are compassionate," Tim said.
"Compassionate? What does that mean?" Anna asked.
"It means they are nice and kind. They help each other and they don't hurt the other team. They say sorry when they make a mistake. They share their water and their snacks. They taste good," Tim said.
"They taste good? How do you know?" Anna asked, surprised.
"Because I tasted one," Tim said, smiling.
"You tasted one? When? How?" Anna asked, shocked.
"When we came here, I saw a girl from the yellow team sitting on the bench. She had a cut on her knee and she was crying. I felt sorry for her, so I went to her and gave her a hug. Then I licked her knee to make it better. She stopped crying and smiled at me. She said thank you and gave me a cookie. She tasted good," Tim said, proud.
Anna stared at Tim, not sure what to say. She looked at the girl on the bench, who was now playing again. She looked happy and healthy. She looked at Spot, who was licking his paws. She looked at Tim, who was licking his lips.
"Tim, you are a very compassionate boy. But you are also a very silly boy. You don't taste people. You taste food. People are not food. People are friends. Do you understand?" Anna said, gently.
Tim nodded, a little embarrassed. He understood. He was sorry. He didn't mean to be rude. He just wanted to help.
"OK, then. Let's watch the game some more. And next time, if you want to taste something, ask me first. I have some candy in my pocket. Do you want some?" Anna said, forgiving.
Tim smiled, grateful. He wanted some. He liked candy. He liked Anna. He liked the game. He liked the park. He liked the day.
He blew a kiss to the girl on the bench. He gave a hug to Spot. He took a candy from Anna. He tasted it. It was sweet. It was good. He was happy.
Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play in the park. They had a red ball, a blue bike and a yellow bowl. They shared their toys and had fun together.
One day, a big dog came to the park. It was black and brown and had a loud bark. Tom and Lily were scared of the dog. They ran to their mom and hid behind her.
"Mom, mom, there is a big dog in the park! It is scary and noisy! Can we go home?" they cried.
Mom looked at the dog and smiled. She knew the dog. It was Rex, the dog of her friend Sara. Rex was a friendly and harmless dog. He just wanted to play.
"Tom and Lily, don't be afraid of Rex. He is a good dog. He won't hurt you. He likes children and toys. Why don't you say hello to him and give him your yellow bowl? He loves to play fetch." Mom said.
Tom and Lily were not sure. They liked their yellow bowl. They did not want to lose it. But they also wanted to be brave and kind. They decided to try.
They walked slowly to Rex and said hello. Rex wagged his tail and licked their faces. He was happy to see them. He saw the yellow bowl and barked. He wanted to play fetch.
Tom and Lily threw the yellow bowl and Rex ran after it. He brought it back and dropped it at their feet. He wanted them to throw it again. Tom and Lily laughed and played with Rex. They had a lot of fun.
Mom and Sara watched them and smiled. They were proud of Tom and Lily. They learned to overcome their fear and make a new friend. They learned that not all dogs are scary and that some are harmless and playful. They learned to share their toys and be generous. They learned a valuable lesson in the park.
Anna and Ben were playing with their balloons in the park. They liked to blow them up and let them go. They watched them fly away in the sky.
"Look, mine is higher than yours!" Anna said.
"No, mine is faster than yours!" Ben said.
They argued and argued. They did not see the little bird that was flying near them. The bird was hungry and curious. It saw the balloons and thought they were fruits. It flew towards them and tried to bite them.
"Ouch!" the bird cried. The balloon popped in its mouth. It was not a fruit. It was a bad thing. The bird was scared and hurt.
Anna and Ben heard the bird. They looked and saw it on the ground. It was shaking and spitting. They felt sorry for the bird.
"Are you okay, bird?" Anna asked.
"We are sorry, bird. We did not know you would try to eat our balloons." Ben said.
The bird looked at them with sad eyes. It could not speak. It wished they had not released their balloons in the air. It wished they had been more careful and kind.
Anna and Ben learned a lesson. They learned that their balloons could hurt other animals. They learned that they should not be ignorant and selfish. They learned that they should share and respect the park.
They picked up the bird and took it to a vet. They hoped the bird would get better. They promised to never play with balloons in the park again. They decided to play with balls instead. They also decided to be friends and not fight. They were happy and grateful. The bird was happy and grateful too.
Lila and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a new thing in the park. It is green and has many sharp points. Lila and Tom are curious.
"What is that?" Lila asks.
"I don't know. Let's go and see," Tom says.
They walk to the new thing. It is a cactus. A sign says "Do not touch. It can hurt you."
Lila and Tom look at the cactus. They see some flowers on it. The flowers are pink and yellow. They are pretty.
"Wow, the cactus has flowers!" Lila says.
"Yes, it does. They are nice," Tom says.
They smile at the cactus. They think it is a good thing. They are happy to see something new.
"Can we say hello to the cactus?" Lila asks.
"Sure, we can. But we have to be careful. We can't touch it," Tom says.
They wave to the cactus. They say "Hello, cactus. You are pretty. We like you."
The cactus does not say anything. But it seems to smile back at them. Lila and Tom are glad. They have made a new friend.
Lily and Ben are playing in the park. They like to imagine they are animals. Lily is a cute bunny and Ben is a big lion. They hop and roar and chase each other.
"Rawr! I'm going to catch you, bunny!" Ben says.
"No, you can't! I'm too fast and smart!" Lily says.
They run to the slide and slide down. They see a sign that says "exit". They don't know what it means.
"What is exit?" Lily asks.
"I don't know. Maybe it's a secret door to another place," Ben says.
They go to the sign and push it. It opens and they see a lot of cars and people.
"Wow! Look at all the colors and noises!" Lily says.
"Let's go and explore!" Ben says.
They hold hands and walk out of the park. They see a lot of things they have never seen before. They are very curious and excited. They forget they are animals and start to talk to the people.
"Hello! We are Lily and Ben. We are playing in the park. What are you doing?" they say.
The people are surprised and amused by the two children. They smile and talk to them. They tell them about the exit and the street and the shops. They also tell them to be careful and not to go too far.
Lily and Ben learn a lot of new words and things. They have a lot of fun. They also miss their mom and dad. They decide to go back to the park and find them.
They say goodbye to the people and thank them. They go back to the exit and push it. It opens and they see the park again.
They run to the slide and slide down. They see their mom and dad waiting for them. They hug them and tell them about their adventure.
"We imagined we were animals and we found an exit and we saw a lot of cars and people and shops and we learned a lot of new words and things!" they say.
Mom and dad are happy and proud of them. They also tell them to be careful and not to go out of the park without them.
They all go home and have a nice dinner. Lily and Ben tell their mom and dad more stories about their imagination. They are very happy. They love to imagine.
Sara likes to go to the station with her dad. She likes to see the big trains that go fast and make loud noises. She likes to wave at the people who get on and off the trains. She likes to look at the pictures and signs that tell where the trains are going.
One day, Sara sees a new train at the station. It is very big and shiny and has many colors. It has a funny face on the front and a long tail on the back. It looks like a dragon. Sara thinks it is the most beautiful train she has ever seen.
Sara asks her dad if they can ride the dragon train. Her dad says yes, but they have to wait in a long line. Many other people want to ride the dragon train too. It is a very popular train. Sara does not mind waiting. She is very excited.
When it is their turn, Sara and her dad get on the dragon train. They find a seat near the window. Sara looks out and sees the station getting smaller and smaller. The dragon train starts to move. It goes faster and faster. It makes a loud roar. Sara feels like she is flying.
Sara smiles. She is very happy. She loves the dragon train. She hopes they can ride it again soon.
Tom and Lily were playing in the garden. They liked to dig in the dirt and look for bugs. They had a green tray where they put their bugs. They had a lot of bugs: ants, worms, beetles, and a big spider.
"Look at my spider, Lily!" Tom said. "It is so big and hairy. It can make webs and catch flies."
"Yuck, Tom!" Lily said. "I don't like spiders. They are scary and ugly. I like beetles. They are shiny and pretty. They can fly and make noises."
Tom and Lily started to argue. They both wanted their bugs to be the best. They did not want to share their green tray. They pulled and pushed the tray. The tray fell on the ground. The bugs ran away.
"Oh no, Tom! Look what you did!" Lily cried. "You made our bugs go away. Now we have no bugs to play with."
"It's not my fault, Lily!" Tom shouted. "You made our bugs go away. You were mean and greedy."
Tom and Lily were very angry and sad. They did not want to play with each other anymore. They went to their own corners of the garden. They did not have any fun.
Mama came to the garden. She saw Tom and Lily sitting alone. She saw the green tray on the ground. She saw the dirt and the empty holes.
"What happened here, Tom and Lily?" Mama asked. "Why are you not playing together? Where are your bugs?"
Tom and Lily told Mama what happened. They blamed each other for the mess. They said they did not like each other's bugs. They said they did not want to share their green tray.
Mama was very disappointed and angry. She did not like to see Tom and Lily fight. She did not like to see them waste their bugs. She did not like to see them be selfish and rude.
"Tom and Lily, you are very naughty!" Mama said. "You should not fight over your bugs. You should not throw your green tray. You should not hurt your bugs. You should be kind and gentle. You should share and take turns. You should say sorry and hug each other."
Tom and Lily did not listen to Mama. They did not want to say sorry. They did not want to hug each other. They did not want to share and take turns. They did not want to be kind and gentle. They wanted to keep their bugs and their green tray.
Mama was very sad and tired. She did not know what to do with Tom and Lily. She took the green tray and the bugs. She said they could not play with them anymore. She said they had to go to their rooms and think about what they did. She said they had to stay there until they were sorry and nice.
Tom and Lily did not like that. They cried and screamed. They did not want to go to their rooms. They did not want to lose their bugs and their green tray. They did not want to think about what they did. They wanted to play in the garden.
But Mama did not change her mind. She took them to their rooms. She closed the doors. She left them alone. She hoped they would learn their lesson.
Tom and Lily were very unhappy. They missed their bugs and their green tray. They missed playing in the garden. They missed each other. They wished they had not fought. They wished they had been nice. They wished they had said sorry and hugged each other.
But it was too late. They had made a big mistake. They had lost their fun. They had a bad ending.
Lily and Max were friends who liked to play together. One day, they saw a big brown pumpkin in the garden. They both wanted to take it home and make a pie.
"I saw it first!" Lily said. "It is mine!"
"No, I saw it first!" Max said. "It is mine!"
They started to pull the pumpkin from both sides, but it was too heavy and hard. They could not move it at all.
"Stop it!" a voice said. It was Mama, who came to see what was going on. "Why are you fighting over the pumpkin?"
Lily and Max told her their reasons, but Mama shook her head.
"That is not a good way to share," she said. "You should discuss and find a fair solution. Maybe you can take turns, or cut the pumpkin in half, or make a pie together."
Lily and Max looked at each other. They felt sorry for being mean and selfish. They decided to make a pie together and share it with Mama and Papa.
"Thank you, Mama," they said. "We learned our lesson. Discussing is better than fighting."
Mama smiled and hugged them. She was proud of them for being kind and cooperative. She helped them to wash and cut the pumpkin, and they had a fun time making the pie. They enjoyed the sweet and warm pie, and agreed that it tasted better when they shared it.
Lily and Tom were friends. They liked to play with rocks and pages. They made shapes and pictures with rocks on pages. They had fun.
One day, Lily found a big rock. It was shiny and smooth. She liked it very much. She showed it to Tom.
"Look, Tom, I have a big rock. It is pretty. Do you want to see?" Lily said.
Tom looked at the rock. He wanted it. He was greedy.
"Give me the rock, Lily. It is mine. I saw it first." Tom said.
"No, Tom, it is mine. I found it. It is important to me." Lily said.
They fought over the rock. They pulled and pushed. They yelled and cried.
Then, the rock slipped from their hands. It fell on the ground. It broke into pieces.
Lily and Tom were sad. They looked at the broken rock. They looked at each other. They were sorry.
They lost the rock. They lost their fun. They lost their friendship.
Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they find a shiny coin on the ground. Anna picks it up and puts it in her pocket.
"Look, Ben, I have a coin!" she says. "It is very pretty and bright. I can buy candy with it."
Ben feels sad. He does not have a coin. He wants candy too. He thinks Anna is not nice. He says, "That is not fair. You should share the coin with me. We are friends."
Anna thinks for a moment. She remembers that Ben is her friend. She remembers that sharing is good. She feels sorry for Ben. She says, "You are right, Ben. We are friends. I will share the coin with you. We can buy candy together."
Ben smiles. He is happy. He says, "Thank you, Anna. You are very kind and humble. I am sorry I was angry. You are a good friend."
Anna and Ben hug. They go to the candy store. They buy candy with the coin. They share the candy. They are happy. They are friends.
Lily and Ben were playing in the backyard. They liked to pretend they were animals and make noises. Lily was a cat and Ben was a dog. They chased each other around the grass and the trees.
"Meow, meow, I'm a cat!" Lily said.
"Woof, woof, I'm a dog!" Ben said.
They ran and jumped and had fun. But then they saw something big and black and shiny. It was the grill. Dad used it to cook food sometimes. It had a lid and a handle and wheels. Lily and Ben were curious. They wanted to see what was inside.
They walked closer to the grill. They heard a hiss and a sizzle. They smelled something good. They saw smoke coming out of the lid. They wondered what Dad was cooking.
"Let's look inside!" Ben said.
"OK!" Lily said.
They reached for the handle. But then they heard a loud voice.
"Hey, kids, stay away from the grill! It's hot and dangerous!" Dad said.
Lily and Ben were fearful. They let go of the handle. They felt the heat from the grill. They saw Dad coming towards them. They did not want to get in trouble.
They turned around and ran away. But they did not run fast enough. Dad caught them by their shirts. He lifted them up and hugged them.
"I'm sorry, Dad, we were just curious," Ben said.
"We didn't mean to touch the grill," Lily said.
"I know, I know, but you have to be careful. The grill can burn you and hurt you. You have to stay away from it when I'm cooking. OK?" Dad said.
"OK, Dad, we're sorry," Lily and Ben said.
Dad smiled and kissed them. He put them down and held their hands. He led them to the picnic table. He showed them what he was cooking. It was burgers and hot dogs and corn. It looked yummy.
"Here, you can have some of these. They're not hot anymore. They're just right. But remember, never touch the grill. It's not a toy. It's a tool. OK?" Dad said.
"OK, Dad, we understand. Thank you for the food. It smells good. Can we still play animals?" Lily and Ben said.
"Sure, you can play animals. But only on the grass and the trees. Not near the grill. And be nice to each other. Cats and dogs can be friends. OK?" Dad said.
"OK, Dad, we will. We love you. You're the best," Lily and Ben said.
They hugged Dad and took their plates. They ate their food and enjoyed it. They were happy. They went back to playing animals. They crawled and barked and meowed. They were careful and safe. They had fun.
Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to swing and slide and run. They saw a big dog with brown fur and a long tail. The dog was barking and jumping. Lily and Ben wanted to pet the dog.
"Hello, doggy!" Lily said. She walked to the dog and reached out her hand. The dog growled and showed his teeth. He did not like Lily. He was a wild dog.
"Be careful, Lily!" Ben said. He ran to Lily and tried to pull her away. The dog was faster. He bit Lily's hand and made her cry. He was a terrible dog.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Lily screamed. She was hurt and scared. Ben was angry and brave. He slapped the dog on the nose and made him yelp. He was a good brother.
"Go away, doggy!" Ben shouted. He picked up a stick and waved it at the dog. The dog was not afraid. He snarled and jumped at Ben. He bit Ben's leg and made him fall. He was a mean dog.
"Help, help, help!" Lily and Ben cried. They needed help. They hoped someone would hear them and save them. But no one came. The dog was hungry and strong. He ate Lily and Ben and licked his lips. He was a happy dog.
Ben and Mia are playing in the kitchen. They see a big file on the table. It has many papers inside.
"What is this?" Ben asks.
"It is a file. Mom uses it for work. She writes and draws on the papers," Mia says.
"Can we look at them?" Ben says.
"No, we can't. Mom says we should not touch her file. It is important and she needs it," Mia says.
But Ben is curious. He wants to see the papers. He reaches for the file. Mia tries to stop him.
"Ben, no! Mom will be mad!" Mia says.
But it is too late. Ben pulls the file and it falls on the floor. The papers fly everywhere. Some of them land on the stove, where Mom is cooking.
"Oh no!" Ben and Mia say.
They hear a loud ring. It is the smoke alarm. The papers are on fire. They smell spicy and bad.
"Help! Help!" Ben and Mia shout.
Mom runs to the kitchen. She sees the fire and the mess. She grabs a pot and pours water on the stove. She turns off the ring. She puts out the fire.
"Ben! Mia! What have you done?" Mom says.
She is angry and scared. She hugs them and checks if they are hurt.
"We are sorry, Mom. We wanted to see your file. We did not mean to make a fire," Ben says.
"It is okay, my loves. I am glad you are safe. But you should never touch my file or the stove. They are dangerous. You could get burned or hurt. Do you understand?" Mom says.
"Yes, Mom. We understand. We are sorry. We love you," Ben and Mia say.
Mom smiles and kisses them. She picks up the file and the papers. Some of them are wet and burned. She is sad, but she is happy that her children are okay.
She says, "I love you too. But next time, please listen to me and play with your toys. Okay?"
"Okay, Mom," Ben and Mia say.
They go to their room and play with their toys. They do not touch the file or the stove again.
Lily and Ben are friends. They like to go to the park and play. One day, they see a big board near the slide. The board is red and shiny. It looks fun.
"Let's go on the board!" Lily says. She is playful and curious.
"OK!" Ben says. He is playful too. They run to the board and climb on it.
The board is not a board. It is a car. A bad man is in the car. He sees Lily and Ben on his car. He is angry and mean.
"Hey, get off my car!" he yells. He starts the car and drives away.
Lily and Ben are scared. They scream and cry. They want to go back to the park. They want to see their moms and dads. But the bad man does not stop. He takes them far away.
The end.

"Sorry, Lila, I don't have a pin. Maybe you can ask Tom, he is good at sewing." Mia said.
Lila ran to Tom, who was in charge of the costumes. He was busy with many clothes and scissors and needles. She showed him her dress and asked him for a pin.
"Hi, Lila, you are a famous dancer. You need a good dress. I don't have a pin, but I can sew your dress. Give it to me, it will only take a minute." Tom said.
Lila gave him her dress and waited. She hoped he would be fast. She did not want to miss her show. She heard the music start and saw the other dancers go on the stage. She was nervous.

"I see it, Tim. It is big and white. Where is it going?" Lily asks.
"I don't know. Maybe to another park. Maybe to see other kids. Do you want to go on a plane, Lily?" Tim says.
Lily thinks for a moment. She likes to see new things. But she does not like loud noises. She shakes her head.
"No, Tim. I don't want to go on a plane. It is too loud. It hurts my ears. I like to play here with you. This is our park. It is quiet and nice." Lily says.

Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They saw a big hill with many ants. Lily wanted to march with the ants. She said to Ben, "Let's march with the ants. They look fun."
Ben was scared of the ants. He said to Lily, "No, Lily. The ants are not fun. They can bite. They can have poison. We should not march with them."
But Lily did not listen to Ben. She was curious and brave. She ran to the hill and started to march with the ants. She followed them to their home. She saw a big hole in the ground. She wanted to see what was inside.
Ben shouted to Lily, "Lily, come back! That is the ant home. You cannot go inside. It is dark and dangerous. You can get lost or hurt."
But Lily did not hear Ben. She was too busy marching with the ants. She was clumsy and slipped. She fell into the hole. She screamed and cried. The ants were angry and scared. They bit Lily with their poison. Lily felt pain and sick. She could not get out of the hole.
Ben ran to the hole. He tried to help Lily. He called for help. But it was too late. Lily was gone. Ben was sad and sorry. He wished he had stopped Lily from marching with the ants. He learned a hard lesson. He never marched with the ants again.
Lily liked to play with her toy bear. She called him Bobo and gave him hugs and kisses. She took him everywhere with her, even to the park. One day, she saw a big slide and wanted to try it. She left Bobo on a bench and ran to the slide.
"Can I go on the slide, Mommy?" she asked.
"Sure, honey, but be careful," Mommy said.
Lily climbed up the ladder and slid down with a big smile. She liked the slide so much, she wanted to do it again. She ran back to the ladder, but then she saw something that made her stop. A boy was holding Bobo and walking away.
"Hey, that's my bear!" Lily shouted. She ran after the boy and tried to get Bobo back.

"Mommy, he took my bear! He said it's his now!" she cried.
Mommy hugged Lily and said, "Don't worry, sweetie, we'll get your bear back. Come on, let's go talk to him."
Mommy and Lily followed the boy to a swing. He was swinging Bobo and laughing.
"Excuse me, young man, can I have a word with you?" Mommy said.
The boy looked at Mommy and Lily and said, "What do you want?"
Mommy said, "That bear you have belongs to my daughter. She loves him very much and she's very upset. Can you please return him to her?"
The boy said, "No, I like this bear. He's different from my other toys. He has a red scarf and a blue hat. He's mine now."
Mommy said, "I understand that you like the bear, but he's not yours. He's Lily's. She got him as a gift from her grandma. He's very special to her. How would you feel if someone took your favorite toy?"
The boy thought for a moment. He remembered his toy truck that he always played with. He liked his truck very much and he would be sad if someone took it.
He looked at Lily and saw that she had tears in her eyes. He felt sorry for her. He said, "I'm sorry, I didn't know. Here, you can have your bear back."
He gave Bobo to Lily and said, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you cry."

Mommy said, "Thank you, young man, for being kind and honest. You did the right thing."
The boy said, "You're welcome. I'm sorry for being mean."
Mommy said, "It's okay, we all make mistakes. Maybe you can play with Lily and Bobo sometime. They're very friendly."
The boy said, "Okay, maybe I can. What's your name?"
Lily said, "I'm Lily. What's yours?"
The boy said, "I'm Jake. Nice to meet you."
Lily said, "Nice to meet you too, Jake. Do you want to go on the slide with me?"
Jake said, "Sure, that sounds fun."
Lily and Jake ran to the slide and became friends. Mommy watched them and smiled. She was happy that Lily got her bear back and that she made a new friend. She was proud of both of them for being brave and kind. She thought, maybe different is not so bad after all.
Lily was a wealthy girl who lived in a big house with many toys. She liked to play with her dolls and dress them in pretty clothes. One day, she decided to have a tea party with her dolls in the living room. She brought a tray with cups and plates and cookies from the kitchen.
She saw a big armchair near the window that looked very cozy. She wanted to sit there with her dolls and have tea. But the armchair was too heavy for her to move. She tried to push it and pull it, but it did not budge. She felt sad and frustrated.
She went to find her daddy, who was working in his office. She knocked on the door and said, "Daddy, can you help me? I want to move the armchair to the window, but it is too heavy for me."
Her daddy smiled and put down his papers. He followed her to the living room and saw the armchair and the tray. He said, "You want to have a tea party with your dolls? That sounds like fun. I can help you move the armchair, but you have to help me too."
He lifted one side of the armchair and asked Lily to lift the other side. Lily put her hands under the armchair and tried to lift it. It was still heavy, but with her daddy's help, she could lift it a little bit. Together, they moved the armchair to the window and placed it gently on the floor.
Lily was very happy and thanked her daddy. She arranged her dolls on the armchair and gave them cups and plates and cookies. She invited her daddy to join her tea party. He said, "Thank you, Lily. You are very kind and strong. I'm proud of you."
They sat on the armchair and had a lovely tea party. They talked and laughed and enjoyed the cookies. Lily felt very happy and loved. She hugged her daddy and said, "I love you, daddy. You are the best."

Lily liked to play with her tap. She had a big tub of water and some cups and spoons. She liked to fill the cups with water and pour them out. She liked to make bubbles and splashes. She liked to hear the tap go drip-drip-drip.

Ben waited until Lily was not looking. He ran to the tub and grabbed the tap. He pulled it hard. He wanted to make the water come out faster. But he pulled too hard. The tap came off the tub. Water sprayed everywhere. The tap was broken. Lily saw what Ben did. She screamed and cried. She was very upset. She loved her tap.
Lily's mom heard the noise. She came to see what was wrong. She saw the water and the broken tap. She saw Lily crying and Ben looking sorry. She was not happy. She told Ben to say sorry to Lily. She told Lily to calm down. She told them both to play nicely. She took the broken tap and the tub away. She gave them some books and toys instead. She hoped they would learn to share and be careful.
Ben and Mia like to play outside in the sunshine. They have a big sandbox with many toys. They can make castles, bridges, and roads with the sand. They work hard and have fun.
One day, the sky is gray and it rains a lot. Ben and Mia cannot play outside. They are sad and bored. They look out the window and see the wet sand. They miss their sandbox.
"Can we go outside, Mom?" Ben asks.
"No, sweetie, it is too wet and cold. You will get sick," Mom says.
"When will it be dry again?" Mia asks.
"Maybe tomorrow, if the sun comes out," Mom says.
Ben and Mia hope the sun will come out soon. They want to play in their sandbox again. They find some books and puzzles to do inside. They try to have fun, but they still think about the sand.
The next day, they wake up and see the sun shining. They are happy and excited. They run to the window and see the dry sand. They put on their hats and shoes and grab their toys.
"Can we go outside, Mom?" Ben and Mia ask.
"Yes, you can, but don't forget your sunscreen," Mom says.

Lily and Ben are squirrels. They love to play in the big park. They run and jump and climb on the trees. They look for nuts to eat and hide.
One day, they find a very big nut. It is brown and shiny and smells good. They both want the nut. They say to each other:
"I saw it first. It is mine!" says Lily.
"No, I saw it first. It is mine!" says Ben.
They start to fight over the nut. They pull and push and bite and scratch. They make a lot of noise.
A big bird hears them. It is a hawk. It has sharp claws and a long beak. It likes to eat squirrels. It sees Lily and Ben fighting over the nut. It thinks: "What a tasty snack!"
The hawk flies high in the sky. It swoops down to catch Lily and Ben. They are too busy fighting to notice. They are in danger.
But then, a friendly dog sees the hawk. It is Rex. He lives in the park with his human. He likes to chase birds. He sees the hawk trying to catch Lily and Ben. He thinks: "No, you don't!"
Rex barks loudly. He runs to the tree where Lily and Ben are. He jumps and snaps at the hawk. The hawk is scared. It drops the nut and flies away.
Lily and Ben see Rex. They realize what he did. They feel ashamed. They say to Rex:
"Thank you, Rex. You saved us. You are very brave and kind."
"You are welcome, Lily and Ben. I am glad you are safe. You are my friends."
Lily and Ben hug Rex. They say to each other:
"We are sorry, Lily. We are sorry, Ben. We were silly and greedy. We should not fight over a nut. We should share and care."
They break the nut in half. They give one half to Rex. They eat the other half together. They are happy. They learned a lesson. They love each other.
Ben and Mia like to ride their bikes in the park. They have red bikes with bells and baskets. They go fast and ring their bells. They see many things in the park: trees, flowers, dogs, birds.
One day, they see a big hill. Ben says, "Let's ride down the hill. It will be fun." Mia says, "No, Ben. The hill is too high and steep. It is not safe." Ben says, "Don't be scared, Mia. I will go first and show you." Mia says, "OK, Ben. But be careful."
Ben rides his bike to the top of the hill. He looks down and sees a rough path with rocks and holes. He thinks, "This will be fun." He pushes his bike and goes down the hill. He goes very fast and feels the wind in his hair. He rings his bell and shouts, "Whee!"
But then, he sees something on the path. It is a big olive. Someone dropped it from their picnic. Ben tries to avoid the olive, but he can't. His bike hits the olive and slips. Ben falls off his bike and rolls down the hill. He hurts his head, his arms, his legs. He cries, "Ow, ow, ow!"
Mia sees Ben fall and cries, "Ben, Ben, are you OK?" She runs down the hill to help him. She sees blood and dirt on him. She is very scared and sad. She says, "Ben, I told you not to ride down the hill. It was not safe. Why did you not listen to me?" Ben says, "I'm sorry, Mia. I wanted to have fun. But I was wrong. The olive made me fall. It was a bad olive." Mia says, "It's OK, Ben. I forgive you. But we need to get help. You need a doctor." She hugs him and calls for help. The end.
Lily liked to paint. She had many colors and brushes. She made pictures of flowers, animals and people. She was happy when she painted.
One day, she had a new friend, Ben. Ben also liked to paint. He had a big box of paints. He wanted to show Lily his pictures. He said, "Look at my paintings. They are very good. I can paint better than you."
Lily felt sad. She did not like Ben's words. She said, "Your paintings are nice, but mine are nice too. We can paint different things. We can learn from each other."
But Ben was bossy. He said, "No, you have to paint like me. You have to use my colors and my brushes. You have to copy my pictures. Then you can be a good painter."
Lily did not want to do that. She liked her own colors and brushes. She liked her own pictures. She said, "No, thank you. I want to paint my way. You can paint your way. We can be different and still be friends."
But Ben did not listen. He took Lily's paints and brushes. He said, "You have to do what I say. I am the best painter. You have to follow me."
Lily was angry. She wanted her paints and brushes back. She said, "Give me my things. You are not the best painter. You are a bad friend. You are not nice."
Ben laughed. He said, "I was just joking. I wanted to see how you would react. I don't really care about your paintings. I just wanted to have fun."
Lily did not think it was a joke. She thought it was a mean thing to do. She said, "That is not a joke. That is a hurtful thing to do. You made me feel bad. You did not respect me. You did not have fun. You were rude."
Ben felt sorry. He realized he was wrong. He said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I was wrong. I should not have been bossy. I should not have taken your things. I should not have laughed at you. I should have been kind. I should have been a good friend."
Lily forgave Ben. She said, "It's okay, Ben. I forgive you. But please don't do that again. Please be nice. Please be a good friend."
Ben nodded. He said, "I will, Lily. I will be nice. I will be a good friend. Can we paint together?"
Lily smiled. She said, "Yes, we can paint together. We can share our colors and brushes. We can make our own pictures. We can learn from each other. We can have fun."
They painted together. They made beautiful pictures. They were happy. They were good friends.
The moral of the story is: Don't be bossy. Be kind. Respect others. Be a good friend.
Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play together. One day, they saw a big box in the living room. They wondered what was inside. They asked their mom, but she said it was a surprise.
"Can we open it, please?" Tom begged.
"No, you have to wait until dad comes home. He has some news for you," mom said.
Tom and Lily were curious. They wanted to know the news. They hoped it was something amazing, like a new toy or a trip to the zoo. They decided to sneak a peek at the box while mom was busy in the kitchen.
They lifted the lid and saw a lot of fur and a wet nose. It was a puppy! They were so happy. They hugged the puppy and gave it a name. They called it Spot.
"Look, mom, look! We found a puppy in the box! He is so cute and soft! Can we keep him?" Lily shouted.
Mom came running to the living room. She looked shocked and angry. She took the puppy from their arms and put it back in the box.
"No, you can't keep him! He is not yours! He is a gift for your cousin Jake, who is sick in the hospital. You were not supposed to open the box! You ruined the surprise!" mom scolded.
Tom and Lily felt sad and sorry. They started to cry. They wanted to keep the puppy. They did not like their cousin Jake. He was mean and bossy. He always complained when they visited him.
"Why do we have to give him the puppy? He does not deserve it! He will not take good care of him! He will make him unhappy!" Tom protested.
"Stop it, Tom! You are being selfish and rude! Jake needs the puppy more than you. He has no friends and he is very lonely. The puppy will cheer him up and make him feel better. You should be happy for him, not jealous. Now go to your room and think about what you did. You are both grounded for a week. No TV, no games, no snacks. And no more puppies!" mom said.
Tom and Lily went to their room, sobbing. They hated their mom. They hated their cousin Jake. They hated the news. They wished they never opened the box. They wished they had the puppy. They wished they had an amazing surprise. But they had none. They had nothing.
Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play together. Lily's birthday is soon. Tom wants to give Lily a gift. He thinks hard. What does Lily like?
Tom remembers that Lily likes to draw. He has an idea. He plans to make a gift for Lily. He finds some paper, crayons and stickers. He draws a picture of Lily and him. He writes "Happy Birthday Lily" on the paper. He puts some stickers on the picture. He is happy with his gift.
The next day, Tom goes to Lily's house. He knocks on the door. Lily's mom opens the door. She smiles and says, "Hello, Tom. Come in. Lily is waiting for you."
Tom goes inside. He sees Lily in the living room. She has a big smile on her face. She says, "Hi, Tom. I'm so glad you came. Do you want to play with me?"
Tom says, "Yes, I do. But first, I have something for you. It's a gift. I made it for you. Happy birthday, Lily."
He gives Lily the picture. Lily looks at the picture. She sees herself and Tom. She sees the words and the stickers. She is very happy. She says, "Wow, Tom. This is a beautiful gift. Thank you so much. You are a good friend. You are very honest. You made this gift with your own hands. I love it."
She hugs Tom. Tom hugs her back. They are both happy. They play together. They have a lot of fun. They are good friends.
Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play with their toys. They had many toys because their parents were wealthy and loved them very much. They had dolls, cars, trains, books, puzzles, and a big plane that could fly in the air.
One day, Tom and Lily decided to play with the plane in the backyard. They took turns to make the plane zoom and soar and loop in the sky. They pretended they were pilots and passengers and had fun.
"Look, Lily, I can make the plane go very high!" Tom said, holding the remote control.
"Wow, Tom, that's amazing! Can I try?" Lily asked, reaching for the remote.
"OK, but be careful. Don't make the plane crash!" Tom warned, handing her the remote.
Lily smiled and pressed the buttons. She made the plane go up and down and left and right. She was having a blast.
"Look, Tom, I can make the plane do a flip!" Lily said, making the plane spin in the air.
"Wow, Lily, that's awesome! But watch out for the tree!" Tom shouted, pointing to a big tree in the corner of the yard.
Lily looked and saw the tree. She tried to steer the plane away, but it was too late. The plane hit the tree and fell to the ground. It broke into pieces.
"Oh no, Lily, you broke the plane!" Tom cried, running to the plane.
"I'm sorry, Tom, I didn't mean to!" Lily sobbed, following him.
They both looked at the plane and felt very sad. They loved the plane and had so much fun with it. They wondered if their parents would be angry with them.
"Tom, Lily, what happened?" their mother asked, coming out of the house. She saw the plane and the twins.
"Mommy, we were playing with the plane and Lily made it crash into the tree and it broke!" Tom explained, pointing to the plane.
"Mommy, I'm sorry, I didn't see the tree and I couldn't stop the plane and it broke!" Lily repeated, hugging the plane.
Their mother looked at them and smiled. She hugged them both and said, "It's OK, my loves. I know you didn't mean to break the plane. It was an accident. Accidents happen sometimes. The plane is just a toy. It can be fixed or replaced. But you are my children. You are more important than any toy. I love you very much."
Tom and Lily felt better. They hugged their mother and said, "We love you too, Mommy. Thank you for being so nice to us. You always provide us with everything we need and want. You are the best mommy in the world."
Their mother kissed them and said, "You are welcome, my loves. You are the best twins in the world. Now, let's go inside and have some cookies and milk. How does that sound?"
Tom and Lily nodded and smiled. They followed their mother inside, leaving the plane behind. They knew they would play with it again someday, but for now, they were happy to have their mother and each other.
Tim and Lily were friends who liked to play in the park. One day, they found a big bottle under a tree. It had a cork and a paper inside. Tim opened the bottle and took out the paper.
"Look, Lily, it's a message!" he said. "Maybe it's from a pirate or a fairy."
Lily looked at the paper. It had many words and pictures on it. She could not read the words, but she saw a map and a cross.
"Maybe it's a treasure map!" she said. "Maybe it shows us where to find gold and jewels."
Tim and Lily decided to follow the map. They walked and ran and jumped until they came to a big house with a fence and a gate. The map said the treasure was under a flower pot near the door.
"Wow, this is a wealthy house!" Tim said. "Maybe the people who live here are pirates or fairies."
Lily nodded. She saw a flower pot near the door. She lifted it and saw a hole in the ground. She reached inside and felt something hard and shiny.
"Tim, I found it! I found the treasure!" she said. She pulled out a necklace with a big red stone. It sparkled in the sun.
Tim was happy for Lily. He looked at the necklace and smiled.
"That's a beautiful necklace, Lily," he said. "You should keep it. It's yours."
Lily hugged Tim and thanked him. She put the necklace around her neck and felt very special.
"Thank you, Tim. You are a good friend," she said. "But I don't want to keep the treasure all to myself. I want to share it with you. Here, you can have this ring. It has a blue stone. It matches your eyes."
Tim was surprised and touched. He took the ring and put it on his finger. It fit perfectly.
"Thank you, Lily. You are a good friend, too," he said. "But we should not stay here too long. The people who live here might come back and get angry. Let's go back to the park and play with our treasure."
Tim and Lily agreed. They put the flower pot back and ran away from the house. They went back to the park and played with their treasure. They felt very happy and lucky. They did not know that the message in the bottle was a joke from a naughty boy who lived in the house. He had put his old toys in the hole and made the map for fun. He did not care about the treasure. He only wanted to make someone laugh. He did not know that he had made Tim and Lily very happy. He did not know that they had found something more valuable than gold and jewels. They had found friendship.
Timmy was a chubby boy who loved jam. He ate jam on toast, jam on crackers, jam on pancakes. He had a big jar of jam in his room that he hid from his mom. He did not like to share his jam with anyone.
One day, Timmy went to the park with his mom and his little sister, Lily. Lily was a thin girl who did not like jam. She liked carrots and apples and cheese. She had a small bag of snacks in her mom's purse. She did not mind to share her snacks with anyone.
At the park, Timmy saw a big dog. The dog was brown and fluffy and had a red bow on its neck. The dog looked friendly and wagged its tail. Timmy wanted to pet the dog, but he was afraid. He hid behind his mom and watched the dog.
Lily saw the dog too. She was not afraid. She ran to the dog and said, "Hello, doggy! You are so cute! Can I pet you?" The dog licked her face and let her pet its fur. Lily giggled and said, "You are so soft and warm! Do you want a snack?" She took out a carrot from her bag and offered it to the dog. The dog sniffed the carrot and ate it. Lily smiled and said, "You like carrots? Me too! Do you want another one?" She gave the dog another carrot and the dog wagged its tail.
Timmy watched Lily and the dog. He felt angry and jealous. He wanted to pet the dog too, but he did not have any snacks to give. He thought of his jam in his room. He wished he had brought some jam with him. He thought the dog would like jam more than carrots. He thought he could make the dog like him more than Lily. He decided to go back to his room and get some jam.
He told his mom, "Mom, I need to go to the bathroom. Can I go back to the room?" His mom said, "Okay, but hurry back. Don't be long." Timmy nodded and ran to the room. He did not go to the bathroom. He went to his closet and took out his jar of jam. He opened it and smelled it. It was sweet and sticky. He licked his lips and said, "This is the best jam ever. The dog will love it. Then the dog will be my friend and not Lily's." He took a spoon and scooped some jam. He put it in his pocket and ran back to the park.
He saw Lily and the dog still playing. He walked up to them and said, "Hi, Lily. Hi, doggy. Can I play with you?" Lily said, "Sure, Timmy. This is a nice doggy. He likes carrots. Do you have any carrots?" Timmy said, "No, I don't have any carrots. But I have something better. I have jam. Do you want some jam, doggy?" He took out the spoon with jam and showed it to the dog. The dog sniffed the jam and barked. He did not like jam. He liked carrots. He thought the jam was yucky and bad. He growled at Timmy and bit his hand. Timmy screamed and dropped the spoon. The jam spilled on the ground and on his clothes. He cried and said, "Ow, ow, ow! The dog bit me! The dog bit me!" His mom heard him and ran to him. She saw the blood and the jam and the dog. She said, "Oh, Timmy, what did you do? Why did you bring jam to the park? Why did you try to feed the dog jam? You know dogs don't like jam. You know jam is for people, not for dogs. You were naughty and foolish. Now you are hurt and messy. Come on, let's go to the nurse and clean you up." She took Timmy by the hand and led him away. Lily followed them and said, "Bye, doggy. Thank you for playing with me. You are a good doggy. I hope you are not in trouble. I hope you find more carrots." The dog barked and wagged its tail. He licked Lily's face and bowed his head. He was sorry for biting Timmy, but he was glad for meeting Lily. He liked Lily. She was a nice girl. She liked carrots. He liked carrots. They were friends.
Lily and Ben are playing in the park. They see a big rope hanging from a tree. They want to swing on it.
"Can I go first?" Lily asks.
"OK, but be careful," Ben says.
Lily runs to the rope and grabs it. She swings high and low. She feels happy and free.
"Wow, you are good at swinging!" Ben says.
"Thank you. Your turn now," Lily says.
She lets go of the rope and lands on the grass. She gives the rope to Ben.
Ben swings on the rope too. He tries to go higher than Lily. He laughs and shouts.
Lily watches him and smiles. She sees a big bush near the tree. She has an idea.
"I'm going to hide. You have to find me," she says.
She runs to the bush and crawls inside. She thinks Ben will not see her.
Ben stops swinging and looks around. He does not see Lily.
"Where are you, Lily?" he calls.
He hears a giggle from the bush. He knows where she is.
He runs to the bush and tries to get in. But the bush is too small for him. He does not fit.
"Lily, come out. I found you," he says.
Lily comes out of the bush. She is proud of her hiding spot.
"You are good at hiding," Ben says.
"Thank you. You are good at swinging," Lily says.
They hug and smile. They are happy. They play some more.
Once upon a time there was a lazy fox. He was always so lazy that he would never try to do anything. One day, he decided to move to the left side of the woods to find something to eat. As he was walking along he spotted a nut. The nut was so big and tasty, it made his mouth water.
The lazy fox tried to open the nut, but it wouldn't budge. He tried and tried but he was too lazy to put any effort in. He decided to give up and said, "Oh well, I guess I can't have this nut". 
Just then, a wise old owl flew overhead. He noticed the poor fox and said, "I can help you open that nut if you try one more time". The fox looked up at the owl but shook his head and replied, "No thank you, I'm much too lazy to try again". 
The owl stared down at the fox sadly and said, "Then I guess you will never get to have the nut". The fox sadly watched as the owl flew away and he never had the nut. 
The End.

Her mom gave her a stern look. "Jane, it's very important for you to follow the rules. You need to stay in bed."
Finally, Jane relented and crawled into bed. As she lay there, she felt bored. She wished she could be coloring with her crayons.
Suddenly, Jane perked up. She realized that boring doesn't have to mean not doing anything. Instead, boring can mean that you stay in one place and rest, which is also important for you to be able to stay healthy. So Jane decided to stay in bed and rest.

 Once there was a bunny who was very fancy. He was always wearing a bowtie and introducing himself with a lot of flare. He thought he was the best because he was so fancy. 
One day, the bunny hopped over to a pond to take a drink of water. A fish was swimming in the pond, so the bunny called out, "Hey Fish! I'm fancier than you, so why don't you move and let me drink the water!" The fish said nothing and just kept swimming. 
This made the bunny angry. He hopped over to the fish and yelled again, "Move, fish!" The fish said nothing and kept swimming in circles. Seeing the fish wouldn't move, the bunny got angry and said, "If you don't move, I'll bite your tooth!"

At the park, Tim saw his friend Sam. Sam looked at Tim's toy gun and said, "That's not fair! I want to play with the gun too!" Tim thought for a moment and decided to share his toy gun with Sam. They took turns playing with the gun and had lots of fun.
After playing, Tim and Sam sat down to rest. Sam looked at Tim and said, "Thank you for sharing your toy gun with me. That was very kind of you." Tim smiled and said, "You're welcome, Sam. Sharing is caring." And from that day on, Tim and Sam always shared their toys and had lots of fun together. The moral value of the story is that sharing is caring and it brings happiness to everyone.
Once upon a time, there was a brown dog named Max. Max loved to play with his friends in the park. One day, Max went to the park and saw a new toy. It was a big, brown ball with a long string.
Max wanted to play with the ball, but he needed to attach the string to something. He looked around and saw a big tree. Max ran to the tree and tried to attach the string to a branch. He jumped high, but he could not reach it.
A little girl saw Max and wanted to help. She used a stick to attach the string to the branch. Now, Max could play with the ball. He was so happy to touch the ball with his nose and watch it bounce. Max and the little girl played together all day.
Once upon a time, there was a wealthy man named Bob. He had a big house and lots of food. One day, he cooked a big pot of spaghetti for dinner. Bob loved spaghetti very much.
Bob's friend, Tim, came to visit. Tim was not careful and spilled the spaghetti on the floor. Bob was sad but he knew that everyone makes mistakes. So, Bob said "I forgive you, Tim."
Together, they cleaned up the mess and cooked more spaghetti. They laughed and had a great time. From that day on, Bob and Tim were better friends. They learned that saying "I forgive you" can make everything better.
Once upon a time, there was a naughty pet named Max. Max was a little dog who loved to play all day. He liked to run, jump, and bark with his friends.
One sunny day, Max saw a big tree with a swing. He wanted to hang on the swing and play. Max jumped up, grabbed the swing, and started to hang on it. He swung back and forth, having lots of fun.
But Max was naughty and did not wait for his turn. The other pets wanted to play on the swing too. They all learned to share and take turns. Max was not naughty anymore, and they all played happily together.
Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a colorful jar of jam. It was red, blue, and yellow. The jam was very happy in its jar.
One day, the jam went for a walk. It rolled and rolled down the street. Then, it met a big cat. The cat said, "Hello, jam! You are very colorful." The jam was happy to meet the cat.
The cat and the jam played all day. They laughed and had fun. The sun went down and it was time to go home. The cat and the jam said goodbye. The jam rolled back to its house, happy to have a new friend.
One day, a little girl named Lily went to her friend Tim's house. Lily wanted to borrow Tim's long jump rope. Tim said, "No, I don't want to share my long jump rope today." Lily was sad.
Lily went back home and told her mom about Tim not sharing his long jump rope. Her mom said, "Maybe Tim is having a bad day. Let's try again tomorrow." Lily agreed and felt better.
The next day, Lily went to Tim's house again. This time, Tim said, "Yes, you can borrow my long jump rope." Lily and Tim played with the long jump rope and had lots of fun. They were happy friends again.
Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tim. Tim had a very pretty voice. He loved to sing all day long. One day, a big, mean cat heard Tim's voice. The cat wanted to catch Tim.
Tim was scared but he was a clever bird. He knew he needed to protect himself from the cat. Tim thought of a plan. He flew high up in the tree and hid behind some leaves. The cat could not see Tim.
The cat tried to climb the tree, but it was too hard for him. He got tired and went away. Tim was safe now. He was very happy that he could protect himself. From that day on, Tim always sang from high up in the tree, so the big, mean cat could never catch him.
Sara and Tom are twins. They like to play in their room. They have many toys and books. They also have a big fan on the ceiling.
One day, Sara has an idea. She says to Tom, "Let's play a game. We can spin the fan and pretend it is a windmill. We can be farmers and grow healthy food."
Tom likes the idea. He says, "OK, Sara. How do we play?"
Sara says, "We need to turn on the fan and make it spin fast. Then we can use our blankets and pillows to make a farm. We can pretend they are fields and animals. We can also use our blocks and cars to make a barn and a tractor."
Tom says, "That sounds fun, Sara. Let's do it."
They turn on the fan and make it spin fast. They use their blankets and pillows to make a farm. They pretend they are farmers and grow healthy food. They use their blocks and cars to make a barn and a tractor. They have a lot of fun.
But then, their mom comes in. She sees the fan spinning fast and the room messy. She says, "Sara and Tom, what are you doing? You should not spin the fan so fast. It is dangerous. And you should not make such a mess in your room. You need to clean up."
Sara and Tom feel sorry. They say, "We are sorry, mom. We were playing a game. We were farmers and we grew healthy food."
Their mom says, "I see. That is a nice game. But you need to be careful and tidy. You can play the game again, but you need to spin the fan slower and put away your things when you are done."
Sara and Tom say, "OK, mom. We will do that. Thank you for letting us play the game."
Their mom says, "You are welcome, Sara and Tom. I love you. You are good and healthy children."
She hugs them and kisses them. Then she helps them clean up their room. They finish the game and have a snack. They are happy.
Lily and Tom were two playful goats who lived in a valley with their mother. They liked to jump and run on the hills and eat the green grass. One day, they saw a big tent near the river. They were curious and wanted to see what was inside.
They ran to the tent and peeked through a hole. They saw a man and a woman who were cooking something on a fire. They smelled something yummy and their mouths watered. They heard the man say, "This soup will serve us well for dinner. It has carrots and potatoes and beans."
Lily and Tom wanted to taste the soup. They thought the man and the woman would not mind if they had a little sip. They waited until the man and the woman went to fetch some water from the river. Then they sneaked into the tent and found the pot of soup. They dipped their noses into the pot and slurped the soup.
But the soup was very hot and spicy. It burned their tongues and made them cough. They ran out of the tent, bleating and crying. The man and the woman heard the noise and came back. They saw the goats and the spilled soup and were angry.
"Hey, you naughty goats! You ruined our dinner! Go away and don't come back!" the man shouted.
Lily and Tom felt sorry and ashamed. They ran back to their mother and told her what they had done. Their mother scolded them and said, "You should not take what is not yours. You should respect other people's things. You should say sorry to the man and the woman and offer to help them."
Lily and Tom nodded and agreed. They went back to the tent and apologized to the man and the woman. They offered to help them clean the mess and find some more food. The man and the woman forgave them and thanked them. They shared some bread and cheese with them and invited them to stay for the night.
Lily and Tom learned their lesson and became friends with the man and the woman. They enjoyed the warm tent and the cozy fire. They slept well and dreamed of more adventures in the valley.
Tommy was a playful boy who liked to wake up early and run around the house. He had a big stomach that was always hungry for breakfast. One morning, he woke up before his mom and dad and decided to make some toast by himself. He climbed on a chair and reached for the bread and the toaster.
"Tommy, what are you doing?" his mom asked, coming into the kitchen. She saw him holding the bread and the toaster cord. "That's dangerous, Tommy. You could get hurt. Let me help you."
But Tommy did not listen. He wanted to do it by himself. He plugged the toaster into the wall and pushed the bread inside. He smiled and waited for the toast to pop out.
Suddenly, there was a loud bang and a flash of light. The toaster had exploded and sparks flew everywhere. Tommy screamed and fell off the chair. His mom ran to him and hugged him. She smelled something burning. She looked at Tommy's stomach and saw a big red mark. The toaster cord had touched his stomach and burned him.
"Tommy, Tommy, are you okay?" she asked, crying. She picked him up and ran to the phone. She called the doctor and told him what happened. She said they needed to go to the hospital right away.
Tommy was not okay. He was in a lot of pain and he was scared. He wished he had listened to his mom and not played with the toaster. He learned a hard lesson that day. He never tried to make toast by himself again.
Sara and Ben were friends who liked to play outside. One day, they decided to wake up very early and see the sunrise. They set their alarm clock and put on their warm clothes.
They sneaked out of their houses and met at the park. It was still dark and cold, but they were excited. They ran to the top of the hill, where they could see the sky. They waited for the sun to come up.
"Look, Sara, the sun is coming!" Ben said, pointing at the horizon. "It is so pretty and bright!"
"Yes, it is, Ben!" Sara said, smiling. "I'm so happy we did this!"
They hugged and watched the sun rise. It was a beautiful sight. They felt warm and happy.
But then, Sara started to feel dizzy. She had not eaten anything since last night, and she had run too fast. She felt sick and weak. She fell to the ground.
"Sara, are you okay?" Ben asked, worried. He tried to help her up, but she was too heavy. He did not know what to do.
"Ben, I don't feel good," Sara said, faintly. "I need to go home. I need my mom."
Ben felt scared and sad. He wanted to encourage Sara, but he did not know how. He looked around, but there was no one else. He felt alone and helpless.
He started to cry. He wished they had never seen the sunrise. He wished they had stayed in bed. He wished Sara was not sick. He wished he could make her better. But he could not. He could only cry.
Lily and Max were playing in the park. They saw a big box with some toys inside. Lily wanted to play with a shiny crown. She put it on her head and said, "I am a queen. You have to do what I say."
Max did not like that. He wanted to play with a car. He said, "No, you are not a queen. That is a fake crown. It is not real. It is made of plastic."
Lily was angry. She said, "It is not fake. It is real. It is very pretty. You are just jealous. I hate you."
Max was sad. He said, "I don't want to play with you anymore. You are mean. You are not my friend."
He took the car and ran away. Lily was left alone with the crown. She felt sorry. She did not really hate Max. She liked him. She wanted to play with him. She took off the crown and ran after him. She said, "Max, wait. I am sorry. I don't hate you. You are my friend. Can we share the toys?"
Max stopped and looked at her. He saw that she was sorry. He smiled and said, "Okay. I am sorry too. You can be a queen if you want. And I can be a king. We can play together."
They hugged and went back to the box. They found a car and a crown that matched. They put them on and played happily. They were friends again.
Lily loves music. She likes to sing and dance and play with her toy piano. She wants to be a musician when she grows up. She likes to watch musicians on TV and listen to their songs.
One day, Lily goes to the park with her mom and dad. She sees a big stage with many people. She hears music and clapping. She runs to the stage and sees a musician playing a guitar. He has long hair and a funny hat. He sings a song that Lily knows. She likes his song. She wants to sing with him.
She climbs on the stage and goes to the musician. She says hello and starts to sing. She sings very loud and very fast. She does not sing the same words as the musician. She sings her own words. She sings about her mom and dad and her toy piano and her cat.
The musician is surprised. He does not know Lily. He does not know what she is singing. He tries to keep playing his guitar. He smiles at Lily. He thinks she is cute. But he is also embarrassed. He does not want Lily to sing on his stage. He wants to sing his own song.
The people in the park are also surprised. They see Lily on the stage. They hear her singing. They do not understand her words. They think she is funny. But they also think she is rude. They want to hear the musician. They do not want to hear Lily.
Lily's mom and dad are shocked. They see Lily on the stage. They hear her singing. They know she loves music. But they also know she is not supposed to be on the stage. They are embarrassed. They are sorry for the musician. They are sorry for the people. They run to the stage. They call Lily. They tell her to come down. They tell her to say sorry.
Lily stops singing. She sees her mom and dad. She sees their faces. They are not happy. They are angry. She does not understand. She thinks she did something good. She thinks she made music. She thinks she made people happy. She does not know she made a mistake. She does not know she was rude. She does not know she has to say sorry.
She feels sad. She feels confused. She feels embarrassed. She does not want to be on the stage anymore. She does not want to be a musician anymore. She wants to go home. She wants to hug her mom and dad. She wants to play with her toy piano. She wants to forget what happened. She wants to start over.
Tom and Lily were best friends. They liked to play games and sing songs together. One day, they found a big microphone in the park. It was shiny and black and had a long wire.
"Wow, look at this!" Tom said. "Let's try it!"
They took turns to hold the microphone and make funny noises. They laughed and had fun. Then Lily had an idea.
"Let's whisper a secret to each other," she said. "But don't tell anyone else, okay?"
"Okay," Tom said. He leaned close to the microphone and whispered something in Lily's ear. Lily smiled and nodded. Then she whispered something in Tom's ear. Tom frowned and looked sad.
"What did you say?" he asked.
"I said I don't like you anymore," Lily said. "You are mean and boring and I don't want to be your friend."
Tom felt a big hurt in his heart. He dropped the microphone and ran away, crying. Lily laughed and picked up the microphone. She didn't care about Tom. She only wanted to play with the microphone.
But she didn't know that the microphone was not a toy. It was a real microphone that belonged to a man who worked in the park. He used it to talk to the people who came to see the animals and the flowers. He had left it on a bench while he went to get some water.
When he came back, he heard Lily's voice on the loudspeaker. He heard her say that she didn't like Tom and that he was mean and boring. He also heard Tom's cry and saw him run away. He was very angry and sad. He walked up to Lily and took the microphone from her.
"Hey, what are you doing?" Lily said. "Give it back!"
"No, I won't," the man said. "This is not a toy. This is my microphone. And you are a very bad girl. You hurt your friend's feelings with your mean words. You should be ashamed of yourself."
Lily felt scared and sorry. She wanted to say sorry to Tom and to the man, but she couldn't. The man took her by the hand and led her to the park office. He called her parents and told them what she had done. They came and picked her up. They were very angry and sad too. They scolded her and took away her toys. They said she had to be kind and nice to others, or she would have no friends.
Lily cried and cried. She wished she had never found the microphone. She wished she had never whispered that secret. She wished she had been kind to Tom. But it was too late. She had lost her best friend and her fun. She had a very bad day.
Sam and Ben are brothers. They like to play outside. But today it is raining. They are sad. They want to see the sun.
Mom says, "Do not be sad. Rain is good. It makes the plants grow. And sometimes, after the rain, you can see a rainbow. A rainbow is many colors in the sky. It is pretty."
Sam and Ben look out the window. They hope to see a rainbow. But they only see gray clouds. They sigh.
Mom says, "Why don't you play a game inside? You can pay me with hugs and kisses. I have a tough puzzle for you. It has many pieces. Can you put them together?"
Sam and Ben smile. They like puzzles. They run to the table. Mom gives them the puzzle. It is a picture of a rainbow. Sam and Ben start to pay mom with hugs and kisses. They say, "Thank you, mom. You are the best."
They work on the puzzle. It is tough. But they help each other. They find the pieces that match. They make the rainbow. They are happy.
They look out the window again. They see the sun. It is shining. And they see a rainbow. It is many colors in the sky. It is pretty. They clap their hands. They say, "Wow, mom. You were right. Rain is good. And rainbows are good. We love rainbows. And we love you."
Tom and Anna like to play with their toys. They have cars, dolls, blocks and books. But their favorite toy is a rocket. The rocket is big and red and has a window. They pretend to be astronauts and fly to space.
One day, they ask their mom if they can raise the rocket. They want to see how high it can go. Mom says yes, but they have to be careful. She gives them a string and a balloon. They tie the string to the rocket and the balloon to the string. The balloon is full of air and makes the rocket go up.
"Wow, look at our rocket!" Tom says. "It is so high!"
"Yes, it is!" Anna says. "Maybe it can reach space!"
They watch the rocket fly in the sky. They see birds, clouds and the sun. They wave to the rocket and pretend to talk to it.
"Hello, rocket!" Tom says. "How is space?"
"Space is fun!" Anna says in a funny voice. "I see stars and planets!"
They laugh and have fun. They are happy with their rocket. They hope it will come back soon. They love to play with their rocket.
Lily and Ben were very hungry. They wanted to eat turkey for dinner. Mom said she would cook a big turkey in the oven. Lily and Ben helped Mom put salt and butter on the turkey. Then they put it in a big pan and Mom put it in the oven.
Lily and Ben waited and waited. They smelled the turkey and it made their mouths water. They asked Mom, "Is the turkey ready yet?" Mom said, "Not yet, my loves. It needs more time. Why don't you drink some juice and play with your toys?"
Lily and Ben drank some juice and played with their toys. They had fun, but they still wanted to eat turkey. They asked Mom again, "Is the turkey ready now?" Mom said, "Yes, it is. Come and see." She took the turkey out of the oven and put it on the table. It was brown and juicy and smelled delicious.
Lily and Ben ran to the table. They said, "Yay, turkey!" Mom said, "Be careful, it's hot. Let me cut some pieces for you." She cut some pieces of turkey and put them on their plates. She also gave them some carrots and potatoes and gravy.
Lily and Ben ate and ate. They said, "Mmm, this is the best turkey ever. Thank you, Mom." Mom said, "You're welcome, my loves. I'm glad you like it." She ate some turkey too. They all enjoyed their dinner.
When they were done, Lily and Ben looked at the pan. It was empty. There was no turkey left. They said, "Wow, we ate all the turkey. We were very hungry." Mom said, "Yes, you were. And you did a good job. Now, who wants some pie?" Lily and Ben said, "Me, me!" They smiled and hugged Mom. They were happy.
Anna and Ben were hungry. They wanted to eat beef for lunch. They asked their mom to cook beef for them.
"Mom, can we have beef, please?" they requested.
"Sorry, kids, we don't have any beef left. How about some chicken and rice?" their mom said.
Anna and Ben did not like chicken and rice. They liked beef better. They were sad and angry.
"No, we want beef! We want beef!" they shouted.
Their mom was tired and busy. She did not like their shouting. She tried to calm them down.
"Kids, stop shouting. You can't always have what you want. Chicken and rice is good for you. Maybe we can have beef another day," she said.
But Anna and Ben did not listen. They kept shouting and crying. They made a lot of noise.
Their mom had an idea. She remembered that there was a deep freezer in the basement. Maybe there was some beef in there. She went to check.
She opened the freezer and saw a big package of beef. She was happy. She took it out and went back to the kitchen.
"Look, kids, I found some beef! I can cook it for you. Are you happy now?" she said.
Anna and Ben stopped shouting and crying. They saw the beef and smiled. They were happy.
"Yes, we are happy! Thank you, mom!" they said.
Their mom smiled too. She was glad that they were happy. She hoped that they would learn to be more grateful and patient. She put the beef in a pot and started to cook it.
But she did not notice that the beef was very old and frozen. It had a bad smell and a strange color. It was not good to eat. She had forgotten to check the date on the package. She had made a big mistake.
Anna and Ben love to watch fireworks. They like the big, bright colors and the loud noises. Sometimes they make their own fireworks with paper and crayons. They are very creative.
One day, they find a box of real fireworks in the garage. They are curious and excited. They want to see what they can do with them. They take the box to the backyard and open it.
They see many different kinds of fireworks. Some are small and round, some are long and thin, some have funny shapes and colors. They pick one that looks like a star and light it with a match.
The firework makes a hissing sound and shoots up in the air. Then it explodes with a big bang and a shower of sparks. Anna and Ben clap and cheer. They think it is amazing.
They want to try another one. They pick one that looks like a flower and light it. But this time, something goes wrong. The firework does not fly up. It stays on the ground and spins around. It makes a loud whirring noise and sparks fly everywhere.
Anna and Ben are scared. They run away from the firework. They are too close to it. The sparks burn their clothes and hair. They scream and cry.
Mom and Dad hear the noise and come outside. They see the firework and the smoke and the children. They are angry and worried. They put out the fire and take the children inside. They check their burns and bandage them. They hug them and tell them they are okay.
They also tell them they are very naughty. They should never play with fireworks. They are dangerous and not toys. They should only watch them from far away with grown-ups. They should use their creativity for other things, like drawing or singing or building.
Anna and Ben are sorry. They say they are sorry. They promise they will never play with fireworks again. They learn their lesson. They still love fireworks, but only from a safe distance.
Tom and Lily were having lunch with their mom. They liked to eat pasta with cheese and tomato sauce. Mom gave them each a fork and a plate. Tom and Lily were playful. They made funny faces with their forks and pasta.
"Look, Mom, I have a fork nose!" Tom said, putting the fork on his nose.
"That's silly, Tom. I have a fork mouth!" Lily said, putting the fork in her mouth.
Mom smiled and said, "You are very funny, but you also need to eat your pasta. It is yummy and good for you."
Tom and Lily nodded and started to eat. They liked the cheese and tomato sauce. They also liked to make slurping noises with their pasta.
Suddenly, they heard a loud bark outside. They looked out the window and saw a big dog. The dog was brown and fluffy. He had a red collar and a blue ball. He was jumping and running in the yard.
"Wow, look at that dog!" Tom said, dropping his fork.
"He is so cute and playful!" Lily said, forgetting her pasta.
They stared at the dog with big eyes. They wanted to play with him. They wondered if he had a name and a home.
Mom saw them staring and said, "That is Max. He is our new neighbor's dog. He moved in yesterday. Maybe we can go and say hello later, if you finish your lunch."
Tom and Lily smiled and said, "Yes, please, Mom. We want to meet Max. He looks like a fun friend."
They picked up their forks and ate their pasta quickly. They hoped Max would like them too. They were excited to play with him.
Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play together at the park. One day, they saw a big sign that said: "Fun Fair Today! Games, Rides, Prizes!" They ran to their moms and asked if they could go.
"Sure, but you have to stay with us and be careful," their moms said. "And don't spend all your money on the games. They are very hard to win."
Lily and Ben nodded and followed their moms to the fair. They saw many colorful things and heard many loud noises. They rode on the merry-go-round, the slide, and the train. They ate cotton candy, popcorn, and ice cream. They had a lot of fun.
Then they saw a game that looked very easy. It was called "Ring Toss". There were many bottles on a table and many rings on a hook. The man who ran the game said: "Throw a ring and win a prize! Any ring, any bottle, any prize! Only one dollar a try!"
Lily and Ben wanted to play. They each had one dollar left. They looked at the prizes. There were dolls, cars, balls, and books. But there was one prize that they both wanted more than anything. It was a big, fluffy, rainbow unicorn. It was the most beautiful thing they had ever seen.
"Can we have the unicorn if we win?" Lily asked the man.
"Sure, if it's available," the man said. "But it's very popular. Someone might take it before you."
Lily and Ben hoped that no one would take the unicorn. They gave the man their dollars and took their rings. They threw them as hard as they could. But none of their rings landed on a bottle. They all bounced off or fell on the ground.
"Oh no, we lost!" Lily said.
"Sorry, kids, better luck next time," the man said. "But you can have a consolation prize. Choose any of these small toys."
Lily and Ben looked at the small toys. They were not very nice. They were cheap and broken and dirty. They did not want them. They wanted the unicorn.
They looked at the unicorn. It was still there. No one had taken it. It was still available.
"Please, mister, can we have the unicorn instead?" Ben asked.
The man looked at them. He saw their sad faces and their hopeful eyes. He felt sorry for them. He smiled and said: "You know what, kids, you can have the unicorn. You tried very hard and you were very polite. You deserve a special prize."
Lily and Ben could not believe it. They were so happy. They thanked the man and hugged the unicorn. They shared it and played with it. They named it Sparkle. It was their favorite toy.
They learned that sometimes, even if you lose, you can still win. And sometimes, the best prizes are the ones that you hope for.
Sara and Ben were twins who liked to play with their toys. One day, they found a big van in the garage. It was dull and dusty, but they thought it looked fun.
"Let's use the van as a spaceship!" Sara said. "We can go to the moon and see the stars!"
"OK!" Ben agreed. They climbed into the van and pretended to push buttons and turn wheels. They made noises like rockets and lasers.
But then, they heard their dad coming. He was angry. He opened the door of the van and saw them inside.
"What are you doing here?" he asked. "This is my work van. You are not allowed to use it. You could break something or hurt yourself. Get out now!"
Sara and Ben felt scared and sorry. They got out of the van and said, "We're sorry, dad. We just wanted to play. We didn't mean to cause trouble."
Dad sighed and looked at them. He was not so angry anymore. He said, "I know you were just playing, but you have to be careful. The van is not a toy. It is a tool. I use it to carry things and help people. You have to respect other people's things and ask before you use them. Do you understand?"
Sara and Ben nodded. They said, "We understand, dad. We won't use the van again without asking. We're sorry."
Dad smiled and hugged them. He said, "It's OK. I forgive you. But next time, why don't you use your imagination and make your own spaceship out of cardboard boxes and paper? That would be more fun and safe."
Sara and Ben liked that idea. They said, "Thank you, dad. We love you."
They learned a lesson that day. They learned to respect other people's things and to use their imagination. They also learned that their dad loved them and wanted them to be happy and safe.
Lily liked ice cream very much. She liked to eat it on hot days, or when she was sad, or when she was happy. She liked all kinds of ice cream, but her favorite was chocolate. She liked to lick it from a cone, and feel it melt in her mouth.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mom. She saw a man with a cart, who had many cones and ice cream. She asked her mom if she could have one. Her mom said yes, and gave her some money. Lily ran to the man, and said, "Please, can I have a cone with chocolate ice cream?"
The man looked at Lily, and said, "No, you can't. I don't have any chocolate ice cream. I only have vanilla, and strawberry, and mint. You have to choose one of those, or go away."
Lily felt very sad, and very angry. She liked vanilla, and strawberry, and mint, but she wanted chocolate. She said, "But I want chocolate. Why don't you have chocolate? That's not fair."
The man said, "I don't care what you want. You can't have chocolate, because I don't have it. Stop being rude, and take what I have, or leave me alone."
Lily felt tears in her eyes. She thought the man was very rude, and very mean. She didn't want to take what he had, or leave him alone. She wanted to have chocolate ice cream, and make him sorry. She remembered what her mom had taught her, about being polite, and sharing, and saying sorry. But she also remembered what her dad had taught her, about standing up for herself, and not letting people bully her, and being brave.
She looked at the man, and said, "You are rude, and mean, and I don't like you. You should have chocolate ice cream, and you should share it, and you should say sorry. But you don't, and you won't, and you can't. So I will show you what I can do."
She took the money from her mom, and threw it at the man. Then she grabbed a cone, and scooped some vanilla ice cream, and some strawberry ice cream, and some mint ice cream. She made a big mess, and a big pile. Then she smashed the cone on the man's head, and ran away.
She ran to her mom, who was watching with a shocked face. She said, "Mom, I'm sorry, I was bad. But the man was rude, and mean, and he didn't have chocolate ice cream. I wanted to teach him a lesson."
Her mom hugged her, and said, "Lily, I love you, but you can't do that. You can't throw money, or grab cones, or smash ice cream. That's not polite, or nice, or brave. That's rude, and mean, and silly. You have to say sorry to the man, and to me, and to yourself. And you have to learn to accept what you have, and not what you want. Maybe next time, you will find chocolate ice cream, and you will be happy. But today, you have to be sorry, and sad, and sorry."
Lily nodded, and said, "I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry, me. I was rude, and mean, and silly. I will learn to accept what I have, and not what I want. But I still like chocolate ice cream, and I hope I will find it soon."
Her mom smiled, and said, "I still love you, Lily. And I still like chocolate ice cream, too. And I hope we will find it soon, too. But for now, let's go home, and have some water, and some cookies, and some hugs. And maybe, we will remember this day, and laugh, and not cry."
Lily smiled, and said, "OK, mom. Let's go home, and have some water, and some cookies, and some hugs. And maybe, we will remember this day, and laugh, and not cry. And maybe, we will find chocolate ice cream, and be happy, and not sad."
The end.
Lily and Ben were happy to see their new house. They had many boxes to unpack. Mom and Dad said they could help.
"Can I unpack this box?" Lily asked, pointing to a big one.
"Sure, that's your box of toys," Mom said. "Be gentle with them, okay?"
Lily opened the box and saw her favorite things. She had her doll, her teddy bear, her blocks, and her clay. She loved to play with clay. She could make anything with it.
"Look, Ben, I have clay!" Lily said, showing her brother.
"Wow, can I play with you?" Ben asked.
"Okay, but you have to be gentle too," Lily said. "Clay is soft and can break."
They took out some clay and put it on the floor. They started to make shapes and animals. Lily made a flower and Ben made a snake.
"Look, Mom, we made clay things!" they said, holding up their creations.
Mom smiled and praised them. "You are very good at making clay things," she said. "And you are very gentle with them. I'm proud of you."
Lily and Ben felt happy. They liked their new house and their clay. They hugged Mom and thanked her. Then they went back to playing with their clay.
Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play with cars and blocks. One day, they go to the park with their moms. They see a big slide and a swing. They want to try them.
"Let's go to the slide first," Tom says. "I want to go fast."
"OK," Sam says. "But I want to go to the swing later."
They run to the slide. There are many kids there. They have to wait for their turn. Tom and Sam are not happy. They want to slide now.
"Look, there is a number on the slide," Tom says. He points to a sign. It says "4".
"What does it mean?" Sam asks.
"It means only four kids can slide at a time," Tom says. "We have to count."
They start to count the kids on the slide. One, two, three, four. Then one kid slides down. Now there are three.
"Quick, let's go!" Tom says. He pushes Sam to the slide. He follows him.
But the other kids are not happy. They say Tom and Sam are not fair. They did not wait for their turn. They start to yell and cry.
"Hey, you can't do that!" one kid says. "You have to go back!"
"No, we don't!" Tom says. "We want to slide!"
The kid gets angry. He runs to the slide. He tries to pull Tom and Sam off. He pushes them hard.
Tom and Sam lose their balance. They fall off the slide. They hit the ground. They hurt their heads and knees. They start to cry too.
Their moms hear the noise. They run to the slide. They see Tom and Sam on the ground. They see the other kids on the slide. They are not happy.
"What happened?" Tom's mom asks.
"They pushed us!" the kid says. "They did not wait for their turn!"
"Is that true?" Sam's mom asks.
Tom and Sam do not answer. They know they did something bad. They are sorry.
Their moms pick them up. They check their wounds. They are not serious, but they are rare. They need some bandages and kisses.
"Let's go home," Tom's mom says. "You need to rest and learn to share."
Tom and Sam nod. They do not want to play anymore. They do not want to slide or swing. They are sad and ashamed.
They say sorry to the other kids. They say sorry to their moms. They hold their hands. They walk to the car.
They sit on their seats. They are quiet. They look out the window. They see the park. They see the slide and the swing. They wish they had been nice. They wish they had waited for their turn. They wish they had had fun.
Lily and Ben were playing with their toys in the living room. Lily had a big rubber ball that bounced high and made a loud noise. Ben had a small wooden car that rolled fast and made a soft noise. Lily liked to bounce her ball and make Ben look at her. Ben liked to roll his car and make Lily look at him.
"Look at my ball, Ben!" Lily said, bouncing it hard on the floor. "It is so big and fun!"
"Ignore her, car," Ben said, rolling his car on the couch. "She is so loud and silly!"
Lily felt angry. She wanted Ben to play with her and her ball. She bounced her ball harder and harder, hoping Ben would notice. But Ben did not notice. He ignored her and her ball. He only played with his car and his couch.
"Look at my car, Lily!" Ben said, rolling it down the cushion. "It is so fast and cool!"
"Ignore him, ball," Lily said, bouncing it up the wall. "He is so slow and boring!"
Ben felt angry. He wanted Lily to play with him and his car. He rolled his car faster and faster, hoping Lily would notice. But Lily did not notice. She ignored him and his car. She only played with her ball and her wall.
They played like this for a long time, ignoring each other and their toys. They did not have fun. They did not laugh. They did not smile. They felt lonely and sad.
Then, something happened. Lily bounced her ball too high and it hit the ceiling. The ball fell down and hit Ben's car. The car flew off the couch and hit Lily's ball. The ball and the car bounced and rolled together on the floor. They made a big noise and a big mess.
Lily and Ben stopped playing. They looked at their toys. They looked at each other. They felt confused.
"What happened?" Lily asked.
"I don't know," Ben said.
They walked to their toys. They picked them up. They looked at them. They felt curious.
"Can I see your ball?" Ben asked.
"Can I see your car?" Lily asked.
They swapped their toys. They felt their toys. They played with their toys. They felt happy.
"Your ball is big and fun," Ben said.
"Your car is fast and cool," Lily said.
They smiled at each other. They decided to play together. They bounced the ball and rolled the car. They made a loud noise and a soft noise. They had fun. They laughed. They did not ignore. They were friends.
Lila and Tom were best friends. They liked to play in the park and look at the birds and flowers. One day, they saw a big hill with a sign that said "Do not climb". Lila wanted to climb the hill and see what was on the other side. Tom was scared and said no.
"Come on, Tom, it will be fun!" Lila whispered. "Maybe we will find a new land with magic and treasure. The sign is just for grown-ups who are boring and mean. We are brave and smart."
Tom did not think so. He thought Lila was foolish and did not listen to the rules. He did not want to get in trouble or get hurt. But he did not want to lose his friend either. He followed Lila as she ran to the hill and started to climb.
The hill was steep and slippery. Lila and Tom had to hold on to rocks and roots. They got dirty and tired. They heard a loud noise and looked up. It was a plane flying over the hill. Lila and Tom were scared and ducked. They did not know that the plane was just a toy that a boy was flying in the park.
They reached the top of the hill and looked around. They did not see a new land with magic and treasure. They only saw more hills and trees and houses. They felt sad and silly. They wished they had stayed in the park and played with the birds and flowers.
They decided to go back down the hill and say sorry to the sign. They hoped no one had seen them. They learned their lesson and never climbed the hill again. They were still best friends, but they were more careful and wise.
Sara and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big yellow truck. It has many boxes on it. Sara and Tom want to see what is inside the boxes.
"Let's go and look," Sara says. "Maybe there are toys or candy."
"OK," Tom says. "But we have to be quick. Mom will be angry if we are late for meal."
They run to the truck. They climb on it. They open a box. It is full of books. They open another box. It is full of clothes. They open another box. It is full of food.
"Wow," Sara says. "Look at all this food. There are apples and bananas and cookies and cheese. I love food. Do you want some?"
"Yes," Tom says. "I love food too. Let's eat some. No one will know."
They take some food from the box. They sit on the truck. They eat and eat. They are happy.
But they do not see the man who drives the truck. He comes back from the store. He sees Sara and Tom on his truck. He sees the open boxes. He sees the food on the ground. He is very angry.
"Hey, you little thieves!" he shouts. "What are you doing on my truck? How dare you touch my stuff? Get off my truck right now!"
He runs to the truck. He grabs Sara and Tom. He throws them off the truck. He hits them with his hand. He kicks them with his foot. He calls the police.
Sara and Tom are hurt. They are scared. They cry and cry. They wish they never saw the yellow truck. They wish they never ate the food. They wish they listened to Mom. They are in big trouble.
Lily and her daddy were playing in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run. Lily saw a big hill with many rocks. She wanted to climb it.
"Can we go there, daddy?" she asked.
"Sure, sweetie. But be careful. The rocks are sharp and hard," daddy said.
They walked to the hill and started to climb. Lily found a small rock that was shiny and smooth. She picked it up and showed it to daddy.
"Look, daddy! A pretty rock!" she said.
"That's very nice, Lily. You can keep it if you want," daddy said.
Lily smiled and put the rock in her pocket. She saw a bigger rock that was round and brown. She tried to lift it, but it was too heavy.
"Daddy, help me! I want this rock too!" she said.
Daddy came over and looked at the rock. He saw that it was stuck in the ground.
"That's not a rock, Lily. That's a root. It belongs to the tree. We can't remove it," he said.
"Why not, daddy?" Lily asked.
"Because the tree needs it. The root helps the tree get water and food from the ground. If we remove it, the tree will be sad and sick," daddy said.
"Oh, I don't want that. I like the tree. It gives us shade and leaves," Lily said.
"Me too, Lily. The tree is mighty and beautiful. We should respect it and leave it alone," daddy said.
They hugged the tree and said thank you. Then they climbed down the hill and continued to play. Lily was happy with her small rock and her daddy. She learned something new and had fun.
Lila and Ben are twins. They like to play outside in the garden. One day, they discover a big hole in the ground. They wonder what is inside.
"Let's go and see!" says Lila. She is brave and curious.
"OK, but be careful!" says Ben. He is cautious and careful.
They crawl into the hole and see many things. They see rocks and roots and worms and bugs. They see shiny things and soft things and hard things. They see earth.
"Wow, look at this!" says Lila. She picks up a round thing that is red and green and yellow. It is smooth and shiny. It is attractive.
"What is it?" asks Ben. He picks up a similar thing that is blue and white and brown. It is also smooth and shiny. It is attractive.
"I don't know," says Lila. "But they are pretty. Maybe they are jewels or treasures."
"Maybe," says Ben. "Or maybe they are planets. Like the ones we see in the sky at night."
They hold the things in their hands and pretend they are astronauts. They explore the hole and find more things. They have fun and learn new things. They discover earth.
Anna and Ben are playing in their room. They have many toys, but they like the phone best. The phone is old and does not work, but they pretend to call their friends and family.
"Hello, is this Lily?" Anna whispers into the phone. She holds it to her ear and smiles.
"Yes, this is Lily. How are you, Anna?" Ben whispers back. He is hiding under the bed with the other end of the phone.
"I am good, Lily. I am playing with Ben. He is my brother. Do you want to play with us?" Anna whispers.
"Sure, I want to play with you. What are you playing?" Ben whispers.
"We are playing phone. We can talk to anyone we want. It is fun. Do you have a phone, Lily?" Anna whispers.
"No, I don't have a phone. But I have a doll. She is clean and pretty. Do you have a doll, Anna?" Ben whispers.
"Yes, I have a doll. She is clean and pretty too. Her name is Rose. Do you want to see her, Lily?" Anna whispers.
"Yes, I want to see her. Can you show me, Anna?" Ben whispers.
"Okay, Lily. Wait a minute. I will get her for you." Anna whispers. She puts down the phone and runs to her closet. She opens the door and looks for her doll.
But she does not see her doll. She sees something else. Something big and furry and scary. It is a bear! The bear growls and shows its teeth. Anna screams and slams the door.
"Anna, what is wrong? What did you see?" Ben whispers. He crawls out from under the bed and runs to Anna. He hugs her and tries to calm her down.
"Ben, there is a bear in the closet! A big, bad bear! It wants to eat us!" Anna whispers. She is shaking and crying.
"A bear? In the closet? Are you sure, Anna?" Ben whispers. He does not believe her. He thinks she is joking.
"Yes, I am sure, Ben. I saw it with my eyes. It is not a joke. It is real. We have to call for help!" Anna whispers. She picks up the phone and dials a number.
"Hello, is this Mommy?" Anna whispers into the phone. She hopes Mommy will hear her and come to save them.
But Mommy does not hear her. Mommy is downstairs, cooking dinner. She does not know that Anna and Ben are playing with the phone. She does not know that there is a bear in the closet. She does not know that Anna and Ben are in trouble.
Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They saw a big cage with a parrot inside. The parrot had many colors and a long tail. It looked very fancy.
"Hello, parrot!" Lily said. "What is your name?"
The parrot did not answer. It just made a loud noise.
"Maybe he is shy," Ben said. "Or maybe he is hungry. Let's find some food for him."
They looked around and saw some nuts on a tree. They picked some and set them on the ground near the cage.
"Here, parrot, have some nuts," Ben said. "They are yummy and good for you."
The parrot looked at the nuts. He came closer and pecked at them. He liked them very much. He made a happy noise.
"Thank you, kids," the parrot said. "My name is Coco. You are very nice."
Lily and Ben were surprised. The parrot could talk!
"Wow, Coco, you can talk!" Lily said. "That is so cool. Can you say more words?"
Coco nodded. He repeated some words that Lily and Ben said. He also said some words that he learned from his owner. He said hello, bye, good, bad, pretty, and funny.
Lily and Ben laughed. They liked Coco a lot. They played with him for a while. They asked him questions and he answered. They told him stories and he listened.
They had a lot of fun with the fancy parrot.
Tim and Lily were twins who liked to explore new places. One day, they went with their mom to a big building where she had to work. Mom said they could play in the lobby while she talked to some people.
The lobby had many chairs, plants, and paintings, but Tim and Lily were more interested in the elevator. It was a big metal box with a door and buttons. They wanted to see what was inside and where it could take them.
"Let's go in the elevator!" Tim said.
"OK, but we have to be careful," Lily said.
They waited until no one was looking and ran to the elevator. They pushed the door button and the door opened. They stepped inside and saw many more buttons with numbers and arrows.
"Wow, look at all these buttons!" Tim said. "Which one should we push?"
"I don't know. Maybe this one?" Lily said, pointing to a button with a big number 10.
"OK, let's try it!" Tim said, and pushed the button.
The door closed and the elevator started to move. Tim and Lily felt their tummies tickle as the elevator went up and up and up. They looked at each other and giggled.
They reached the tenth floor and the door opened. They saw a long hallway with many doors and windows. They wanted to see what was behind them, but they heard a voice.
"Hey, who are you?" the voice said.
They turned around and saw a man in a suit and a tie. He looked angry and surprised. He was holding a folder and a pen.
"We are Tim and Lily," Tim said.
"What are you doing here? This is a private office. You can't just come here without permission," the man said.
"We are sorry. We just wanted to see the elevator," Lily said.
"The elevator? That's not a toy. That's a machine. It can be dangerous if you don't know how to use it," the man said.
He walked to the elevator and pushed the door button. He looked at Tim and Lily and said, "You should go back to the lobby. Where is your mom?"
"She is working. She said we could play in the lobby," Tim said.
"Well, you should listen to your mom. She knows what's best for you. And you should be humble and not touch things that are not yours," the man said.
He pointed to the button with a big number 1 and said, "This is the button you need to push to go back to the lobby. I recommend you do that right now."
Tim and Lily nodded and pushed the button. The door closed and the elevator started to move. They felt their tummies tickle again as the elevator went down and down and down.
They reached the lobby and the door opened. They saw their mom waiting for them. She looked worried and happy.
"Tim, Lily, where have you been? I was looking for you," she said.
"We went to the elevator," Tim said.
"We saw the tenth floor," Lily said.
"You did what? That's very naughty. You could have gotten lost or hurt. You should never go to the elevator without me," mom said.
She hugged them and said, "I'm glad you're safe. But you have to promise me you won't do that again. OK?"
"OK, mom. We promise," Tim and Lily said.
They learned their lesson and never went to the elevator again. They played with their toys and books in the lobby and waited for mom to finish her work. They were humble and happy.
Sara was a daughter who liked to laugh. She laughed when she played with her toys, when she watched funny shows, and when she tickled her mom and dad. She had a big laugh that made everyone happy.
One day, Sara and her mom went to the park. They saw a big slide that looked fun. Sara wanted to go on the slide, but her mom said no. She said the slide was too high and too fast for Sara. She said Sara could get hurt if she went on the slide. She said Sara was very important to her and she did not want her to get hurt.
But Sara did not listen to her mom. She thought her mom was being silly and mean. She wanted to have fun and laugh on the slide. She waited until her mom was talking to another mom. Then she ran to the slide and climbed up the ladder. She looked down and saw how high and fast the slide was. She felt scared, but she did not want to go back. She wanted to show her mom that she was brave and strong.
She pushed herself down the slide. She went very fast and felt the wind in her hair. She started to laugh, but then she saw something bad. There was a big rock at the end of the slide. She could not stop or turn. She hit the rock with a loud thud. She felt a lot of pain in her head and her body. She stopped laughing and started to cry.
Her mom heard her cry and ran to the slide. She saw Sara lying on the ground, bleeding and hurt. She screamed and picked her up. She hugged her and cried. She said she was sorry and she loved her. She said she wished she had listened to her mom. She said she hoped Sara would be okay. But Sara did not answer. She did not open her eyes. She did not laugh anymore.
Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play with toys and books. Today, they are at Lily's house. Lily's mom says they can have a snack on the table.

"Can we clap?" Ben asks. He likes to clap. He thinks it is fun.
"Sure, we can clap!" Lily says. She likes to clap too. She thinks it is fun.

"What are you doing?" she asks.
"We are clapping!" Lily and Ben say.
"Why are you clapping?" she asks.
"Because we are happy!" Lily and Ben say.
"That's wonderful!" she says. She claps with them. They all clap together. They are happy.
Sara and Ben were playing with their dolls in the living room. They had a big box of clothes and accessories for their dolls. Sara liked to dress her doll in wool sweaters and hats, because they were soft and warm. Ben liked to dress his doll in spicy colors, like red and yellow, because they were bright and fun.
"Look at my doll, Sara," Ben said. "She is wearing a spicy dress and a spicy scarf. She is ready to go to a party."
"I don't like your doll, Ben," Sara said. "She is too spicy. She hurts my eyes. My doll is wearing a wool sweater and a wool hat. She is cozy and cute. She is ready to go to bed."
Sara and Ben started to argue about whose doll was better. They raised their voices and pulled each other's dolls. Sara was so angry that she slapped Ben's doll in the face. Ben was so shocked that he slapped Sara's doll in the head.
"Ow!" Sara and Ben cried at the same time. They dropped their dolls and rubbed their hands. They realized that slapping was not nice. It made them and their dolls feel bad.
"I'm sorry, Sara," Ben said. "I shouldn't have slapped your doll. She is cozy and cute. I like her wool sweater and hat."
"I'm sorry, Ben," Sara said. "I shouldn't have slapped your doll. She is bright and fun. I like her spicy dress and scarf."
Sara and Ben hugged and made up. They decided to share their clothes and accessories. They dressed their dolls in wool and spicy outfits. They agreed that their dolls were both beautiful and happy. They played together nicely and had a lot of fun.
Lily was excited. Today was her birthday. She had a big cake with four candles. She had many presents. She wanted to open them all.
She heard a knock on the door. It was her neighbor, Ben. He was holding a big box with a bow. He smiled and said, "Happy birthday, Lily! I have a present for you."
Lily ran to the door and hugged Ben. She said, "Thank you, Ben! You are very nice. Can I open it now?"
Ben nodded and said, "Yes, you can. I hope you like it. It is something fun."
Lily took the box and opened it. Inside was a beautiful doll with long hair and a pink dress. Lily gasped and said, "Wow! She is so pretty! I love her! What is her name?"
Ben said, "You can name her whatever you want. She is your doll. Do you want to play with her?"
Lily nodded and said, "Yes, I do. Come on, Ben. Let's go to my room. We can have a tea party with her and my other toys."
Lily and Ben went to Lily's room. They played with the doll and had a lot of fun. Lily was very happy. She had the best birthday ever.
Tom and Lily were playing in the garden when they saw a big cloud in the sky. It was dark and angry and made a loud noise. Tom and Lily ran to the house and told their mom.
"Mom, there is a big cloud and it is going to rain a lot!" Tom said.
"Let's go inside and wait for the rain to stop," mom said. "We don't want to get wet and cold."
But Tom and Lily liked the rain. They wanted to splash in the puddles and make boats with leaves. They did not want to go inside and play with their toys.
"Please, mom, can we stay outside for a little bit?" Lily asked.
"No, sweetie, it is not safe. The rain can make a flood and carry you away. You have to listen to me and come inside," mom said.
Tom and Lily did not like mom's answer. They tried to resist and stay outside. They cried and stomped their feet and said no. But mom was firm and took them by the hand and led them inside.
They looked out the window and saw the rain falling harder and harder. The garden was full of water and mud. The flowers and the grass were drowning. The cloud was still in the sky and it was not going away.
Tom and Lily felt sad and scared. They wished they had listened to mom and gone inside sooner. They hugged mom and said they were sorry.
"It's okay, my loves, I forgive you. You are safe and dry now. The rain will stop soon and the sun will come out. Then we can go outside and clean the garden and plant new flowers and grass. But for now, let's play with your toys and read a story. How about that?" mom said.
Tom and Lily nodded and smiled. They followed mom to the living room and picked their favorite toys and books. They forgot about the rain and the flood and the cloud. They only saw mom's love and warmth. They were happy and grateful. They learned a lesson. They would not resist mom again. She knew what was best for them.
Lily and Tom are going on a big plane with Mom and Dad. They are very happy. They want to see new things and play with new friends. Mom and Dad have passports. Passports are like books with pictures and names. They show who you are and where you can go.
At the airport, they have to wait in a long line. Lily and Tom are bored. They want to jump and run and have fun. But Mom and Dad say they have to be quiet and still. They say they have to show their passports to a tall man. The tall man works at the airport. He checks the passports and stamps them.
Lily and Tom are curious. They want to see the tall man and his stamp. They sneak out of the line and run to the tall man. They say hello and ask him what he is doing. The tall man is surprised. He smiles and says he is helping people go on the plane. He shows them his stamp and lets them touch it. He asks them where they are going. Lily and Tom say they are going to a place with a big castle and a lot of flowers. The tall man says that sounds nice. He stamps their passports and gives them back.

Mom and Dad are relieved. They hug Lily and Tom and say they love them. They say they are ready to go on the plane and have a great adventure.
Sara liked to help her mom at the restaurant. Her mom cooked food for many people who came to eat. Sara helped by bringing plates, cups and napkins to the tables. She was very good at carrying things and not dropping them.
One day, the restaurant was very busy. Many people wanted to eat pizza, but the pizza dough was almost gone. Sara's mom asked her to go to the supply room and get more dough. Sara ran to the supply room and looked for the dough. She saw a big box with a picture of a pizza on it. She tried to lift the box, but it was too heavy for her.
She saw a smaller box next to it. It had a picture of a pretzel on it. She thought, maybe this is also dough, but in a different shape. She opened the box and saw many long and flexible pieces of dough. They looked like snakes. She had an idea. She took some pieces of dough and twisted them into circles. She put them on a tray and brought them to her mom.
Her mom was surprised to see the dough circles. She asked Sara, "What are these?" Sara said, "They are pizza pretzels. I made them from the pretzel dough. Maybe the people will like them." Her mom smiled and said, "That was very clever of you, Sara. You are very flexible and creative. Let's try to bake them and see what happens."
They put the pizza pretzels in the oven and waited. They smelled very good. They took them out and put cheese and sauce on them. They looked like mini pizzas. They brought them to the people who wanted pizza. The people were curious and tried them. They liked them very much. They said, "These are delicious. What are they called?" Sara's mom said, "They are pizza pretzels. They are a special invention by my helper, Sara." The people clapped and cheered for Sara. Sara was very happy and proud. She helped her mom at the restaurant and made many people happy.
Dan and Mia are friends. They like to play outside in the sun. One day, Dan has new sunglasses. He puts them on and says, "Look at me, Mia. I am tough. I can do anything."
Mia wants to try the sunglasses too. She asks, "Can I wear them, Dan? Please?" Dan says, "No, Mia. They are mine. You can't have them. They are only for tough kids."
Mia feels sad. She says, "That is not nice, Dan. You are not a good friend. You should share. Sharing is good." Dan says, "No, Mia. You are not tough. You are a baby. Go away."
Mia runs away and cries. She finds her mom and tells her what happened. Her mom hugs her and says, "I am sorry, Mia. Dan was mean to you. He does not know how to be a good friend. He needs to learn. Maybe you can teach him."
Mia wipes her tears and says, "How can I teach him, mom?" Her mom says, "You can show him how to be kind and share. Maybe he will see that you are a good friend and a tough kid too."
Mia thinks for a moment. She says, "Okay, mom. I will try. Thank you." She goes back to Dan and says, "Dan, I am sorry I asked for your sunglasses. They are very cool. But you hurt my feelings. You should not say mean things. That is not how friends talk."
Dan looks at Mia. He sees that she is sad. He feels sorry too. He says, "I am sorry, Mia. I was mean to you. I don't know why. I guess I wanted to show off. But you are right. That is not how friends talk. You are a good friend. And you are tough too. Do you want to try my sunglasses?"
Mia smiles and says, "Yes, please. Thank you, Dan. That is very nice of you. You are a good friend too. And you are tough too. Can we play together?"
Dan nods and says, "Yes, we can. Let's play together. And let's share. Sharing is good." They put on the sunglasses and play in the sun. They have fun. They learn how to be good friends. They are tough and kind.
Lily and Tom are twins. They like to play in the bath. They splash and laugh and make bubbles. Mommy says it is time to get out. She wraps them in big towels and rubs them dry.
"Can I comb your hair, Lily?" Tom asks. He likes to comb his sister's hair. He thinks it is soft and shiny.
"Okay, Tom. But be gentle," Lily says. She sits on the floor and lets Tom comb her hair. He tries to make it look nice. He makes a ponytail and a braid and a bun.
"Look, Lily! You are so pretty!" Tom says. He is proud of his work. He shows Lily a mirror.
Lily looks in the mirror. She does not like what she sees. She thinks Tom made her hair look silly. She feels angry and sad.
"Tom, you are mean! You ruined my hair!" Lily cries. She pulls the comb from Tom's hand and hits him with it. Tom feels hurt and scared. He drops the mirror and it breaks.
Mommy hears the noise and comes to see what is wrong. She sees Lily and Tom crying, the comb on the floor and the broken mirror. She is very angry and disappointed.
"Lily, Tom, what have you done? You are both naughty and careless. You could have hurt yourselves or each other. And you wasted a good mirror. You are in big trouble, young ones. No more bath time for a week. Go to your rooms right now and think about what you did," Mommy says.
Lily and Tom feel ashamed and sorry. They wish they had not fought over the comb. They wish they had been kind and gentle. They hug each other and say sorry. Then they go to their rooms and cry. They have a bad ending.
Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play in their room. They had many toys, but their favorite was a big puzzle with many pieces. The puzzle had a pattern of animals and colors that they had to match.
One day, they wanted to finish the puzzle, but they could not find the last piece. They looked under the bed, in the closet, and in the drawers, but they could not see it. They started to feel sad and angry.
"Where is it?" Lily asked.
"I don't know. Maybe you lost it," Ben said.
"No, you lost it. You are always messy," Lily said.
They began to argue and push each other. They did not notice that their baby brother, Max, had crawled into their room. He saw the puzzle and smiled. He liked the shiny piece that was on the floor. He grabbed it and put it in his mouth.
Lily and Ben stopped fighting when they heard Max giggle. They turned around and saw him with the puzzle piece. They gasped and ran to him.
"Max, no! That's ours!" Lily said.
"Give it back! It's not food!" Ben said.
They tried to take the piece from Max, but he was tough. He held on to it and shook his head. He did not want to let go. He thought it was a game.
Lily and Ben did not think it was funny. They were worried that Max would choke on the piece. They knew they had to be gentle, but firm. They decided to work together and distract Max.
"Look, Max, look!" Lily said. She pointed to a stuffed lion that was on the shelf. "It's a lion. It roars. Can you roar?"
Max looked at the lion and opened his mouth. He made a sound like a lion. He forgot about the puzzle piece.
Ben saw his chance. He quickly took the piece from Max's mouth and put it on the puzzle. He smiled and said, "We did it! We finished the puzzle!"
Lily and Ben hugged each other and cheered. They looked at the puzzle and admired the pattern. They felt happy and proud.
They also looked at Max and felt sorry. They realized that he was just curious and wanted to play. They decided to share their toys with him and teach him how to do the puzzle.
"Max, we're sorry. Do you want to play with us?" Lily asked.
"Yes, please. I like puzzle," Max said.
They gave him a piece and showed him where to put it. He smiled and clapped his hands. He liked the puzzle too.
They played together and had fun. They learned to be nice and helpful. They were a good team.

Anna wants to make the castle pink. She likes pink. She finds some pink paint and a brush. She starts to paint the box. Ben does not like pink. He likes blue. He finds some blue paint and a brush. He starts to paint the box too.
Anna and Ben start to fight. They say mean words. They splash paint on each other. They rip the box. They cry. The castle is ruined. The paint is everywhere. They are dirty and sad.
Mom and Dad come home. They see the mess. They are angry. They scold Anna and Ben. They tell them to clean up. They take away the paint and the cardboard. They send them to their rooms. Anna and Ben have no castle. They have no fun. They have a bad day.
Mia and Leo were twins who liked to play in the garden. They had a small patch of dirt where they planted seeds and watered them every day. They were very proud of their plants and watched them grow.
One day, they saw some red balls poking out of the ground. They were radishes! Mia and Leo were very happy and ran to pick them. They each took one and held it in their hands.
"Look, Leo, we grew radishes!" Mia said. "They are so pretty and round!"
"Yes, Mia, they are!" Leo said. "And they are tasty too! Let's eat them!"
But before they could bite into their radishes, a big rabbit hopped into the garden. It was lively and fast, and it saw the radishes too. It ran towards Mia and Leo and tried to snatch their radishes from their hands.
"Hey, stop that!" Mia shouted. "These are our radishes! We worked hard to grow them!"
"Go away, rabbit!" Leo yelled. "You can't have our radishes! They are ours!"
The rabbit did not listen. It kept jumping and nibbling at the radishes. Mia and Leo tried to hold on to their radishes, but the rabbit was stronger and smarter. It pulled and tugged and bit until it got both radishes and ran away.
Mia and Leo were very sad and angry. They had lost their radishes and their hard work. They looked at the empty patch of dirt and cried.
"Those were our radishes!" Mia sobbed. "We valued them so much!"
"I know, Mia, I know!" Leo said. "The rabbit was mean and greedy! It did not value our work!"
They hugged each other and wiped their tears. Then they saw something in the dirt. It was another seed. They had planted more than two radishes. There were more seeds waiting to grow.
Mia and Leo smiled and dried their eyes. They decided to plant the seed and water it. They hoped it would grow into a big and beautiful radish. And they hoped the rabbit would not come back.
Lily likes to balance on one foot. She thinks it is fun and cool. She can balance for a long time. She shows her mother how she can balance.

"Wow, Lily, you are very good at balancing!" her mother says. She claps her hands and smiles back. "Can you balance on the other foot too?"
Lily nods and puts her left foot down. She lifts her right foot and stands on her left foot. She balances for a few seconds, but then she wobbles and falls down. She laughs and gets up.
"That's okay, Lily, you can try again," her mother says. She hugs Lily and kisses her cheek. "You are very brave and smart. I love you."

"Tom, can I play with you?" she asks.
"No, go away. These are my toys. You have your own toys," Tom says.
"But I want to play with you. You are my brother. Please, let me play with you," Lily says.
Tom does not listen to Lily. He closes the door and locks it. He keeps playing with his toys. He does not care about Lily.
Lily is sad. She goes to her room. She sees her old doll on the bed. She picks it up and hugs it. She sees a bottle of lotion on the dresser. She remembers that her mom gave it to her. She says it is good for her skin. She decides to put some lotion on her doll.
She opens the bottle and squeezes it. But too much lotion comes out. It spills on the doll, on the bed, and on the floor. It is sticky and slippery. Lily tries to wipe it off, but it makes a bigger mess. She does not know what to do.
She hears a loud crash from Tom's room. She runs to see what happened. She sees Tom on the floor. He slipped on his toys and fell. He hurt his knee. It is bleeding. He is crying.
Lily feels sorry for Tom. She forgets about the lotion. She runs to him and hugs him. She says, "I'm sorry, Tom. Are you okay?"
Tom stops crying. He looks at Lily. He sees that she is covered in lotion. He says, "What happened to you? You are all wet and sticky."
Lily says, "I was trying to put lotion on my doll, but I made a mess. I'm sorry, Mom will be mad at me."
Tom says, "It's okay, Lily. I made a mess too. I was playing with my toys, but I did not share with you. I'm sorry, you are my sister. I love you."

Ben and Lily were playing in the park with their ball. They liked to kick the ball to each other and catch it. Sometimes the ball went too far and they had to run after it.
One day, the ball flew over the fence and landed near a big building. Ben and Lily ran to the fence and looked at the building. It was very tall and had many windows. They saw some people working inside.
"Let's go get the ball," Ben said. He climbed over the fence and ran towards the building.
"No, Ben, wait!" Lily said. She was scared. She saw a sign on the building that said "Danger". She did not know what it meant, but she knew it was bad. She tried to warn Ben, but he did not hear her.
Ben reached the ball and picked it up. He was happy. He turned around and saw Lily waving at him. He waved back and smiled. He did not see the big truck that was coming out of the building. The truck was loud and fast. It had a big arm that lifted things.
The truck driver saw Ben and honked his horn. He tried to stop, but it was too late. The truck hit Ben and the ball. Ben fell down and the ball flew away. Lily screamed and cried. She ran to Ben and hugged him. She was very sad.
The truck driver got out of the truck and ran to Ben. He was very sorry. He called for help. He said he did not see Ben. He said Ben should not have been there. He said the building was not safe. He said the sign was a warning.
Lily did not understand. She only wanted Ben to be okay. She hoped he would wake up and play with her again. She hoped the ball would come back. She hoped the building would go away. She hoped the truck would never come back. She hoped the sign would never be there. She hoped the day would be mild and nice again.

Tom does not have a phone. He has a ball. He likes to throw and catch it. He thinks phones are boring.
"I don't want to watch your phone, Lily," Tom says. "I want to play with my ball. Come on, let's have fun."

"It's okay, Lily," Tom says. "I'm glad you came. I was scared. The dog took my ball."
Lily hugs Tom. She says, "I'm sorry, Tom. I was not a good friend. I should have played with you. Your ball is more fun than my phone."
Tom smiles and says, "It's okay, Lily. You are a good friend. Maybe we can share. You can watch my ball and I can watch your phone."
Lily nods and says, "Yes, that sounds good. Sharing is good. We can have fun together."
They hold hands and walk to the playground. They see the dog with the ball. They laugh and chase the dog. They get the ball back and play with it. They also watch some videos on Lily's phone. They are happy and have fun. They learn to share and be kind.

Lily and Tom were playing in the sand. They had a bucket and a spade. They wanted to make a big castle. They dug and piled and patted the sand. They made towers and walls and a door.
"Look at our castle!" Lily said. "It is so pretty!"
Tom nodded. He was proud of their work. He saw a shell on the sand. He picked it up and gave it to Lily. "This is for you," he said. "You are my friend."
Lily smiled. She liked the shell. It was shiny and smooth. She put it on the door of the castle. "Thank you, Tom," she said. "You are my friend too." She gave him a kiss on the cheek.
Tom blushed. He felt happy and shy. He kissed her back on the cheek.
Suddenly, they heard a loud bark. A big dog ran towards them. It was black and hairy. It had sharp teeth and a wet nose. It wanted to play, but it did not know how.
Lily and Tom were frightened. They dropped the bucket and the spade. They ran away from the dog. They hid behind a bench. They held each other's hands.
"Go away, dog!" Lily shouted. "Leave our castle alone!"
The dog did not listen. It jumped on the castle. It knocked down the towers and the walls. It bit the shell and the door. It wagged its tail and barked.
Lily and Tom were sad. They watched their castle fall apart. They cried and hugged each other.
A man came running. He was the dog's owner. He saw the mess and the children. He felt sorry and angry.
"Bad dog!" he scolded. "What have you done? Come here, now!"
He grabbed the dog by the collar. He apologized to Lily and Tom. He offered to help them rebuild their castle. He gave them a new bucket and a new spade.
Lily and Tom stopped crying. They forgave the man and the dog. They decided to give them another chance. They went back to the sand. They started to make a new castle. They hoped it would be bigger and prettier than before.

One day, a little girl named Lily was playing in the forest with her doll. She saw a big house made of candy and wanted to eat some. She ran to the house and broke off a piece of chocolate. But then she heard a loud voice.
"Who is eating my house?" the voice said. It was a witch who lived in the candy house. She came out and saw Lily with the chocolate. She was very angry and grabbed Lily by the arm. "You are a naughty girl! You will be my dinner tonight!" the witch said.
Lily was very scared and cried. She tried to run away, but the witch was too strong. She dragged Lily to the house and locked her in a cage. She said, "I will load you into my oven and cook you. Then I will eat you with some honey and nuts."
Lily was very sad and wished she had not eaten the chocolate. She was ashamed of herself for being greedy and foolish. She prayed for someone to help her.
Luckily, a boy named Max was walking in the forest. He heard Lily's cries and followed them. He saw the candy house and the witch. He was brave and smart. He waited until the witch was busy loading some wood into the oven. Then he sneaked to the cage and opened it. He freed Lily and said, "Come on, let's run away!"
Lily was very happy and hugged Max. She said, "Thank you, you are my hero! I'm sorry I ate the witch's house. I will never do that again."
Max said, "You're welcome. I'm glad you're safe. Let's go home and tell our parents what happened."
They ran out of the house and into the forest. The witch saw them and shouted, "Stop, you little thieves! You will pay for this!" She chased them, but they were faster. They reached their village and told their parents everything. The parents were relieved and proud of Max. They scolded Lily, but also forgave her. They gave them some cookies and milk and hugged them. The witch never bothered them again.

One day, Lisa went to the park with her mom and Anna. She saw some other kids playing with a ball. She wanted to join them, but she did not want to leave Anna alone. She asked her mom if she could put Anna on a bench near the ball.
"Okay, but be careful and don't go too far," her mom said.
Lisa ran to the ball and played with the other kids. She had fun, but she also looked at Anna from time to time. She saw a big boy walking near the bench. He had a mint in his mouth. He saw Anna and picked her up.
"Hey, that's my doll!" Lisa shouted and ran to the boy.
The boy was bossy. He did not listen to Lisa. He said, "This is my doll now. She is better than your other dolls. I like her dress and her hair."
He pulled Anna's hair and tore her dress. He also bit her face with his mint. Anna looked sad and hurt.
Lisa was angry and sad. She cried and tried to get Anna back. She said, "No, she is not your doll. She is my doll. You are mean and bad. You hurt Anna. Give her back to me!"
Her mom heard Lisa and came to help her. She saw what the boy did to Anna. She was mad at the boy. She said, "How dare you do that to Lisa's doll? That is very rude and wrong. You should apologize and give Anna back to Lisa."
The boy was scared of Lisa's mom. He dropped Anna and ran away. He did not say sorry.
Lisa hugged Anna and thanked her mom. She said, "Mom, can you fix Anna? She is broken and dirty. I love her."
Her mom said, "Don't worry, Lisa. We can restore Anna. We can wash her face, sew her dress and comb her hair. She will be as good as new. You are a good girl and you love your dolls."

One night, Tim wants to play with a train that Liz is holding. He says, "Give me the train, Liz. It is my turn to play with it." Liz says, "No, Tim. I am not done with it.

Mom hears them fighting and comes to their room. She sees Tim and Liz pulling the train and yelling at each other. She says, "What is going on here? Why are you not sharing the train?" Tim and Liz both say, "It is mine. I want to play with it." Mom says, "That is not nice. You should yield to each other and take turns. Sharing is caring. If you keep fighting, you will break the train and make each other sad."
Tim and Liz look at the train and see that it is already bent and scratched. They feel sorry and ashamed. They say, "We are sorry, Mom. We were selfish and mean. We will share the train and play nicely." Mom says, "That is good. I am proud of you. Now, it is time to get ready for bed. You are both sleepy and need to rest." She turns off the lamp and gives them a hug and a kiss. Tim and Liz say, "Good night, Mom. We love you." They snuggle in their beds and fall asleep. They dream of happy train rides and adventures.
Anna and Ben were playing in the garden. They liked to pretend they were chefs and prepare food for their dolls and teddies. They used leaves, flowers, rocks and sticks as ingredients. They had a small fire pit where they cooked their dishes.
"Look, Ben, I made a cake with petals and mud," Anna said, holding a round lump of dirt. "Do you want to try some?"
"No, thank you, Anna. I made a soup with water and grass. It smells good," Ben said, stirring a pot over the fire. "Do you want to try some?"
Anna nodded and put her cake down. She went to Ben and took a sip of his soup. She made a face and spat it out. "Yuck, Ben, this is not soup. This is yucky water," she said.
Ben laughed and said, "It's not yucky, Anna. It's yummy. You just don't like it because you're a picky eater."
Anna was angry and said, "I'm not a picky eater, Ben. You're a bad cook. Your soup is gross and your fire is too big. You're going to burn everything."
Ben was angry too and said, "I'm not a bad cook, Anna. You're a mean sister. My soup is delicious and my fire is just right. You're going to ruin everything."
They started to argue and shout at each other. They did not notice that the fire was growing bigger and bigger. They did not notice that the wind was blowing the smoke towards the house. They did not notice that their mom was inside, taking a nap.
The smoke reached the house and set off the alarm. The alarm was loud and scary. It woke up mom and made her jump out of bed. She smelled the smoke and ran to the window. She saw the fire in the garden and her children arguing near it. She felt helpless and scared. She grabbed her phone and called for help. She yelled at Anna and Ben to get away from the fire and come inside.
Anna and Ben heard their mom and saw the smoke. They realized they had made a big mistake. They felt sorry and scared. They dropped their pots and ran to their mom. They hugged her and said they were sorry. They waited for the firemen to come and put out the fire. They learned a lesson that day. They learned to be careful with fire and to be nice to each other.
Lily liked to play the violin. She had a small violin that was just right for her. She learned how to hold it and make sounds with the bow. She wanted to be a good violin player like her mom.
But sometimes Lily did not behave. She would play the violin when she was supposed to be quiet. She would play the violin when her baby brother was sleeping. She would play the violin when her dad was working. She would make loud and funny noises with the violin. She thought it was fun, but it made everyone else unhappy.
One day, Lily's mom took her to a big place where many people played the violin. It was a concert. Lily saw a wide stage with many chairs and stands. She saw a lot of violins and other instruments. She heard beautiful music that made her feel happy and calm.
Lily's mom said, "This is how you play the violin with other people. You have to listen and follow and be gentle. You have to behave and respect the music and the audience. Do you understand?"
Lily nodded. She understood. She wanted to play the violin like that. She wanted to make beautiful music with other people. She wanted to make her mom proud.
She said, "I'm sorry, mom. I will behave. I will play the violin better. Can we go home and practice?"
Lily's mom smiled and hugged her. She said, "Yes, we can. I love you, Lily. And I love your violin."
Tom and Lily were playing with their toy cars in the living room. They liked to zoom them around the carpet and make loud noises. Sometimes they crashed their cars and pretended they were broken.
"Zoom, zoom, zoom!" Tom said as he moved his red car fast. "My car is the best!"
"No, mine is!" Lily said as she moved her blue car faster. "My car can zoom more!"
They zoomed their cars closer and closer until they bumped into each other. Tom's car flew off the carpet and landed on the sofa. Lily's car flipped over and stopped.
"Hey, you made my car fall!" Tom said. He was angry. He grabbed Lily's car and threw it on the floor.
"Hey, you broke my car!" Lily said. She was angry too. She ran to the sofa and took Tom's car. She hid it behind her back.
"Give me back my car!" Tom said. He tried to reach for Lily's car, but she moved away.
"No, you give me back my car!" Lily said. She held Tom's car tightly.
They started to yell and push each other. They did not see their mom coming into the living room. She saw them fighting and was not happy.
"What are you doing?" she asked. She sounded angry. "Why are you being so mean to each other?"
Tom and Lily stopped and looked at their mom. They felt ashamed. They knew they had done something bad.
"We were playing with our cars, but then we crashed and got angry," Tom said.
"We wanted to have the best car, but then we hurt each other's cars," Lily said.
Mom shook her head. She picked up their cars and gave them back to them.
"Playing with cars can be fun, but not when you are selfish and rude," she said. "You should share and be nice to each other. That's what good friends do."
She pointed to the kitchen table. There was a big plate of cheese and crackers.
"I made some snacks for you, but you can only have them if you say sorry and hug each other," she said.
Tom and Lily looked at the cheese and crackers. They looked at each other. They felt sorry for what they had done.
"I'm sorry, Lily," Tom said. "I should not have thrown your car."
"I'm sorry, Tom," Lily said. "I should not have taken your car."
They hugged each other and smiled. They were friends again.
Mom smiled too. She was happy. She took them to the kitchen and gave them some cheese and crackers.
They ate and talked and laughed. They learned their lesson. They decided to play with their cars again, but this time they would zoom them together and have more fun.
Tom and Sam were brothers. They liked to play in the kitchen. They found a big pan on the stove. Tom wanted to bang the pan with a spoon. Sam wanted to wear the pan as a hat.
"Give me the pan!" Tom said. "I want to make noise!"
"No, give me the pan!" Sam said. "I want to be a king!"
They pulled the pan from each other. The pan was heavy and slippery. It fell on the floor with a loud clang. The noise made their mom come to the kitchen.
"What are you doing?" Mom asked. "Why are you fighting over the pan?"
Tom and Sam looked at each other. They felt sorry. They did not want to make mom angry.
"We were playing," Tom said.
"We were having fun," Sam said.
Mom smiled. She picked up the pan and hugged the boys.
"I'm glad you were playing and having fun," Mom said. "But the pan does not belong to you. It belongs to me. I use it to cook yummy food for you. Do you want to help me cook?"
Tom and Sam nodded. They liked to help mom cook. They followed her to the counter. Mom gave them each a bowl and a spoon. She showed them how to mix flour and eggs and milk. They made a batter for pancakes.
"Good job, boys!" Mom said. "You are very successful cooks!"
Tom and Sam smiled. They were happy. They did not need the pan to play. They had mom and each other. They belonged to a family.
Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play together. One day, Tom wants to visit Mia at her house. He walks to her door and rings the bell.
Ding dong! The bell makes a loud sound. Mia hears the bell and runs to the door. She opens it and sees Tom.
"Hi, Tom!" Mia says. "Do you want to play with me?"
"Yes, please!" Tom says. "What do you want to play?"
Mia thinks for a moment. She has a clever idea. She says, "Let's play hide and seek! I will hide and you will seek. Count to ten and then look for me."
"OK!" Tom says. He covers his eyes and starts to count. "One, two, three..."
Mia runs to find a good hiding place. She sees a big box in the living room. She climbs inside the box and closes the lid. She thinks Tom will not find her there.
Tom finishes counting. "Ten! Ready or not, here I come!" He says. He looks around the house. He checks under the bed, behind the sofa, in the closet. He cannot find Mia.
"Where are you, Mia?" He calls. "I give up!"
Mia hears Tom. She smiles. She thinks she is very clever. She decides to surprise Tom. She opens the lid of the box and jumps out.
"Boo!" She shouts. "Here I am!"
Tom is startled. He sees Mia in the box. He laughs. He says, "You are very clever, Mia! You found a good hiding place. You win!"
Mia laughs too. She says, "Thank you, Tom! You are a good seeker. You looked everywhere. You are fun!"
Tom and Mia hug. They are happy. They are good friends. They decide to play another game. They have a lot of fun. They like to visit each other.
Mila and Tom are friends. They like to play with toys and make music. Mila has a drum and Tom has a flute. They make loud and fun sounds with their toys. They are musicians.
One day, they go to the park with their moms. They see a big slide and a swing. They want to try them. They leave their toys on a bench and run to the slide. They take turns to slide down and laugh.
But when they come back to the bench, their toys are gone. They look around and see a boy with a mean face. He has their drum and flute. He says, "These are mine now. Go away!"
Mila and Tom are sad and angry. They want their toys back. They try to solve the problem. They ask the boy nicely, "Please give us our toys. They are ours. We like them very much."
The boy says, "No. They are mine. You can't have them. They make good sounds. I am a musician too."
Mila and Tom say, "No, you are not. You are a thief. You took our toys. That is not nice. Give them back or we will tell our moms."
The boy says, "I don't care. I am bigger and stronger than you. You can't do anything. Go away or I will hit you."
Mila and Tom are scared. They don't want to fight. They look for their moms, but they are far away. They are talking to other moms. They don't see what is happening.
The boy laughs and runs away with their toys. He is happy. He has a drum and a flute. He makes loud and bad sounds with them. He is not a musician. He is a bully.
Mila and Tom cry. They have no toys. They have no music. They have no fun. They are sad. They have a bad day.
Tom and Sue are brother and sister. They like to play with their toys in the living room. But they do not like to share. Sometimes they quarrel over who gets to play with what.
One day, they both want to play with the radio. The radio can make music and sounds. Tom grabs the radio and turns it on. He likes to hear the fast songs. He dances and jumps around.
Sue does not like the fast songs. She likes to hear the slow songs. She tries to take the radio from Tom. She says, "Give me the radio! I want to hear the slow songs!"
Tom says, "No! It is my turn! I want to hear the fast songs!"
They pull and tug on the radio. They yell and cry. They do not listen to each other.
Mom hears the noise. She comes to the living room. She sees Tom and Sue quarreling over the radio. She is not happy. She says, "Stop it! You are making too much noise! You need to share the radio and take turns. Or I will take it away."
Tom and Sue stop quarreling. They do not want to lose the radio. They say, "Sorry, Mom. We will share and take turns."
Mom smiles. She says, "That is good. Now, you can enjoy the music and play nicely."
Tom and Sue hug Mom. They hug each other. They agree to play with the radio together. They listen to the fast songs and the slow songs. They dance and sing along. They have fun.
Lily and Max were playing in the garden. They liked to dig in the dirt and look for shiny things. Sometimes they found coins, buttons, or rocks. But today, they found something very special.
"Look, Lily, look!" Max shouted. He held up a clear, sparkly thing in his hand. "It's a crystal!"
Lily ran over to see. She gasped. The crystal was so pretty. It had many colors inside it, like a rainbow. She wanted to touch it.
"Can I see, Max? Can I hold it?" she asked.
Max nodded. He gave the crystal to Lily. She smiled and rubbed it with her fingers. It felt smooth and cold.
But then, something bad happened. Lily tripped over a root and fell down. She dropped the crystal. It landed on the grass and got dirty.
"Oh no!" Lily cried. "The crystal is all dirty! It's not pretty anymore!"
Max helped Lily get up. He saw the crystal on the ground. He picked it up and wiped it with his shirt. He tried to make it clean again.
"Don't cry, Lily," he said. "The crystal is still pretty. Look, it still sparkles. It's just a little dirty. That's normal. Everything gets dirty sometimes. We can wash it later."
Lily sniffed. She looked at the crystal. She saw that Max was right. The crystal still sparkled. It was still pretty. She felt better.
"Thank you, Max," she said. "You are a good friend. Can we share the crystal?"
Max smiled. He hugged Lily. He was happy that she was happy.
"Of course we can share the crystal," he said. "It's our special find. We can keep it in our treasure box. Come on, let's go show Mom and Dad."
They ran to the house, holding the crystal. They were very proud of their discovery. They had a lot of fun playing in the garden.
Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They see many flowers in the park. Lily likes the yellow flowers. Ben likes the red flowers.
"Look, Lily, a sunflower!" Ben says. He points to a big yellow flower. It is taller than Ben. "It is so pretty!"
Lily runs to the sunflower. She wants to touch it. She reaches up with her hand. But the sunflower is too high. She cannot touch it. She feels sad.
"Ben, help me!" Lily says. "I want to touch the sunflower!"
Ben runs to Lily. He has an idea. He finds a big rock. He lifts the rock. It is heavy. He puts the rock near the sunflower. He climbs on the rock. He is higher now.
"Lily, come here!" Ben says. He holds out his hand. "I can help you!"
Lily climbs on the rock too. She takes Ben's hand. She stands on her toes. She touches the sunflower. It is soft and warm. She smiles.
"Thank you, Ben!" Lily says. "You are a good friend!"
Ben smiles too. He is happy. He and Lily hug. They look at the sunflower. They see a bee. The bee is busy. It likes the sunflower too.
Tim and Mia like to play with their toys. They have many toys, but their favorite is a robot. The robot can talk and move and make funny sounds. Tim and Mia call him Robby.
One day, Tim and Mia are playing with Robby in their room. They make him walk and dance and sing. They are very happy. But then, their mom comes in and says, "Time to clean up, kids. Put your toys away and get ready for dinner."
Tim and Mia do not want to stop playing. They say, "No, mom. We want to play more. Robby is fun."
Mom says, "You can play later, after dinner. But now you have to tidy up. Robby is fragile. He can break if you leave him on the floor."
Tim and Mia resist. They say, "No, mom. Robby is strong. He can not break. He is our friend."
Mom says, "I know, but he is still a toy. And toys need to be taken care of. Come on, help me put him in his box. He will be safe there."
Tim and Mia look at Robby. He looks at them and says, "I am your friend. But I also need to rest. Please put me in my box. I will wait for you."
Tim and Mia feel sad. They love Robby. But they also love their mom. They decide to listen to her. They hug Robby and say, "Bye, Robby. We will play with you later. We love you."
They put Robby in his box and help mom clean up. Mom smiles and says, "Thank you, kids. You are very good. Now let's go have dinner."
Tim and Mia nod and follow mom. They are hungry. They think about Robby and hope he is not lonely. They promise to play with him again soon.
Tom and Lily were playing in their room. They had many toys and books and crayons. They liked to make pictures and stories with them. But they did not like to share.
Tom saw a big book with many animals. He wanted to look at it. But Lily had it first. She said, "This is mine. You can have the other book."
Tom was angry. He said, "No, I want this book. Give it to me." He tried to take it from Lily.
Lily was angry too. She said, "No, this is mine. You can have the scissors." She pushed Tom away.
Tom did not want the scissors. He wanted the book. He shouted, "Give me the book. Give me the book now."
Lily shouted back, "No, no, no. Go away. Go away now."
Their mom heard them shouting. She came to their room. She saw them fighting over the book. She saw the scissors on the floor. She was scared. She said, "Stop, stop, stop. What are you doing? You could hurt each other with the scissors. You have to share and be nice."
Tom and Lily stopped shouting. They looked at their mom. They looked at the book. They looked at the scissors. They felt sorry. They said, "We are sorry, mom. We were not nice. We will share and be nice."
Their mom smiled. She said, "That's good. I'm glad you are sorry. Now, why don't you look at the book together? You can learn about the animals. And you can use the scissors to cut out some shapes. But be careful. And ask me if you need help."
Tom and Lily nodded. They said, "Okay, mom. Thank you, mom." They hugged their mom. Then they looked at the book together. They learned about the animals. They used the scissors to cut out some shapes. They were careful. They asked their mom if they needed help. They had fun. They were happy. They were nice.
Sara and Ben were playing in the yard. They saw a big box with some nails and a hammer. Sara wanted to make something with the nails. Ben said no, it was bad to play with nails. They could hurt themselves.
But Sara did not listen. She took a nail and a hammer and tried to hit the nail on the box. She missed the nail and hit her finger. She cried out loud. It hurt a lot. She dropped the hammer and the nail.
Ben ran to her and hugged her. He said he was sorry. He said they should go to mom and dad. They would make her finger better.
Sara nodded. She was very sad. She regretted playing with the nail. She wished she had listened to Ben. She said she was sorry too. She said she would not play with nails again.
They held hands and walked to the house. Mom and dad saw them and asked what happened. They told them the truth. Mom and dad were not angry. They were glad they were honest. They cleaned Sara's finger and put a band-aid on it. They gave them a hug and a kiss. They said they loved them. Sara and Ben felt better. They learned a lesson. They decided to play with safer things.
Lily was a little girl who liked to play with her toys. She had many toys, but she did not like to share them with anyone. One day, her aunt came to visit her. Her aunt brought a gift for Lily, a big and soft teddy bear.
Lily was very happy to see the teddy bear. She grabbed it from her aunt and hugged it. She said, "Thank you, aunt, this is my teddy bear. It is only mine. No one can touch it."
Her aunt smiled and said, "You are welcome, Lily, but you know, toys are more fun when you share them with others. Maybe you can let your cousin play with your teddy bear when he comes over later. He likes teddy bears too."
Lily shook her head and said, "No, aunt, this is my teddy bear. It is only mine. No one can touch it."
Her aunt sighed and said, "Okay, Lily, but remember, being selfish is not nice. Sharing is caring."
Later, Lily's cousin came over. He saw the teddy bear and said, "Wow, Lily, what a nice teddy bear. Can I play with it?"
Lily said, "No, this is my teddy bear. It is only mine. No one can touch it."
Her cousin felt sad and said, "But Lily, I just want to play with it for a little while. Please, can I hold it?"
Lily said, "No, this is my teddy bear. It is only mine. No one can touch it."
Her cousin got angry and said, "Fine, Lily, you are a mean and greedy girl. I don't want to play with you anymore."
He ran away and left Lily alone with her teddy bear. Lily felt lonely and bored. She looked at her teddy bear and said, "You are my teddy bear. You are only mine. No one can touch you. But you are not fun. You are not wild. You do not talk. You do not laugh. You do not play. You are just a toy."
She realized that her teddy bear was not a real friend. She wished she had shared it with her cousin. She wished she had been nice and caring. She wished she had not been selfish and greedy. She learned a lesson. She decided to say sorry to her cousin and her aunt. She decided to share her toys with others. She decided to be a good and kind girl.
Lily and Ben were playing with their balloons in the park. They liked to blow them up and let them go. They watched the balloons fly up in the sky and make funny noises.
"Look, Lily, my balloon is red like a fire truck!" Ben said.
"Mine is yellow like a sunflower!" Lily said.
They blew up more balloons and released them. They laughed and clapped their hands.
But then, a cop came over to them. He had a blue uniform and a shiny badge. He looked serious.
"Hello, kids. Do you know what you are doing?" he asked.
Lily and Ben stopped playing. They felt scared. They did not know what they did wrong.
"We are playing with balloons, sir," Lily said.
"Balloons are fun, but they can also be dangerous," the cop said. "When you release them, they can go very far and hurt animals or people. They can also make a lot of trash and pollute the air."
Lily and Ben looked at each other. They did not think about that. They felt sorry.
"We are sorry, sir. We did not know," Ben said.
The cop smiled. He was not angry. He was thoughtful.
"It's okay, kids. You did not mean to do anything bad. But now you know better, right?" he said.
Lily and Ben nodded. They did know better.
"Can we keep our balloons, sir?" Lily asked.
"Sure, you can keep them. But don't release them anymore, okay? You can play with them in other ways. You can make shapes or animals or hats with them. Or you can give them to someone who needs a smile," the cop said.
Lily and Ben liked those ideas. They thanked the cop and gave him a hug. They decided to give some of their balloons to the other kids in the park. They made new friends and had more fun. They learned a new word and a new lesson. They were happy.
Sara liked to display her toys on the shelf. She had a doll, a bear, a car and a book. She was proud of her toys and wanted to show them to everyone.
One day, her grandma came to visit. Grandma brought a big bunch of flowers for Sara's mom. They were white and pink and smelled nice. Sara saw a flower that looked like a star. It was a lily. She wanted to have it for herself.
She waited until grandma and mom were talking in the kitchen. Then she sneaked into the living room and took the lily from the vase. She ran to her room and put the lily on the shelf next to her doll. She smiled and thought it was very pretty.
But soon, the lily started to wilt. Its petals turned brown and fell off. Its stem bent and drooped. Sara felt sad and confused. She didn't know why the lily was dying. She thought it would be happy on the shelf with her toys.
She also felt uncomfortable. She knew she had done something wrong. She had taken the lily without asking. She had made grandma and mom unhappy. She wished she could make the lily alive again and put it back in the vase.
She decided to tell the truth. She took the lily and went to the kitchen. She said sorry to grandma and mom and gave them the lily. They hugged her and said they forgave her. They explained that the lily needed water and light to live, not a shelf. They also said that they loved her and were glad that she was honest.
Sara felt better. She learned a lesson. She never took flowers again without permission. She also learned to display her toys in a different way. She shared them with her friends and played with them together. She had more fun and made more memories.
Anna and Ben are playing with their toys in the living room. They hear a loud noise outside. They look out the window and see a big truck. The truck has a sign that says "order". The truck stops in front of their house.
"Look, Ben, the truck is here!" Anna says. "Maybe it has something for us!"
They run to the door and wait for the truck driver. The truck driver gets out and opens the back of the truck. He takes out a big box. The box has a sticker that says "fragile". He carries the box to the door.
"Hello, kids, I have a delivery for you," the truck driver says. "Is your mom or dad home?"
"Yes, they are in the kitchen," Ben says. "We will call them."
They run to the kitchen and tell their mom and dad that the truck driver has a box for them. Their mom and dad come to the door and sign for the box. They thank the truck driver and take the box inside.
"What is in the box, mom?" Anna asks.
"It's a surprise, honey," mom says. "We will open it together."
They go to the living room and put the box on the floor. They carefully cut the tape and open the box. Inside, they find a beautiful dollhouse. The dollhouse has many rooms, furniture, and dolls. It is very colorful and detailed.
"Wow, it's amazing!" Anna says. "Is it for me?"
"Yes, it is, sweetie," dad says. "It's a gift from your grandma. She made it for you with love."
Anna hugs her mom and dad and thanks them. She is very happy. She loves her grandma and her new dollhouse.
"Can I play with it, too?" Ben asks.
"Of course, you can, brother," Anna says. "But we have to be gentle. It's fragile."
They start to play with the dollhouse. They make up stories and have fun. They forget about the noise outside. They don't notice that it starts to rain. They are too busy with their new toy. They are very happy.
Lily liked to play with her toys, but she did not like to share them. She had many toys, but her favorite was a cone that made sounds and lights when she pressed a button. She always kept the cone in her room and never let anyone touch it.
One day, her cousin Sam came to visit. Sam was younger than Lily and he liked to explore. He saw the cone on Lily's bed and wanted to play with it. He reached for the cone, but Lily saw him and shouted, "No! That's mine! Go away!" She grabbed the cone and shut the door in Sam's face.
Sam felt sad and hurt. He did not understand why Lily was so mean. He went to the living room and found some other toys to play with. He found a ball, a car, a doll, and a book. He had fun with them and shared them with Lily's mom and dad.
Lily heard Sam laughing and wondered what he was doing. She opened the door and peeked outside. She saw Sam playing happily with the other toys and her parents. She felt a little jealous and curious. She wanted to join them, but she also wanted to keep her cone.
She decided to take her cone with her and go to the living room. She hoped that Sam would not touch it again. She walked slowly and carefully, holding the cone close to her chest. But as she reached the stairs, she tripped and fell. The cone flew out of her hands and landed on the floor with a loud crash. It broke into many pieces. It did not make any sounds or lights anymore.
Lily cried and cried. She had lost her favorite toy. She wished she had been nicer to Sam and shared her cone with him. Maybe then it would not have broken. She realized that being selfish and rude was not a good way to treat others. She learned that toys are fragile, but friendship is strong. She said sorry to Sam and asked him to play with her. Sam forgave her and hugged her. They played together and had fun. Lily's mom and dad smiled and praised them. They were proud of their children.
Lily liked to do things by herself. She was independent. She did not need help from Mom or Dad or her big brother Tom. She could put on her shoes, brush her teeth, and make her bed.
One day, Lily wanted to reach a book on the top shelf. She saw a chair in the kitchen. She dragged the chair to the bookcase. She climbed on the chair and stretched her arm. But the book was still too high. She stood on her toes and leaned forward. She almost had it.
"Be careful, Lily!" Tom said. He came into the room and saw Lily on the chair. "You might fall and hurt yourself. Let me get the book for you."
"No!" Lily said. She did not want Tom to help her. She wanted to get the book by herself. She seemed angry. She pushed Tom away. She reached for the book again.
But then, the chair wobbled. Lily lost her balance. She screamed. Tom caught her before she fell. He hugged her and put her down. He gave her the book.
"Thank you, Tom," Lily said. She felt scared and sorry. She hugged Tom back. She realized that sometimes, she needed help from others. She was independent, but not always.
Lily and Max were playing in the park. They saw a big castle made of sand. It had towers and flags and a door. Lily and Max wanted to play with the castle.
"Can we go to the castle?" Lily asked Max.
"Yes, let's go!" Max said.
They ran to the castle. But when they got there, they saw a boy sitting next to it. He had a bucket and a shovel. He looked angry.
"This is my castle!" the boy said. "Go away!"
Lily and Max stopped. They felt sad. They wanted to play with the castle, but the boy did not want to share.
"Please, can we play with you?" Lily asked. "Your castle is very nice."
"No!" the boy said. "It is mine! I made it!"
He picked up his shovel and hit the castle. He broke one of the towers. Sand flew everywhere.
Lily and Max gasped. They saw the castle fall apart. They felt angry. The boy was mean. He ruined the castle.
"Stop it!" Max said. "You are bad!"
He pushed the boy. The boy pushed him back. They started to fight.
Lily did not like fighting. She wanted to play. She looked around. She saw another castle. It was smaller, but it was still nice. It had flowers and shells on it. It looked peaceful.
Lily walked to the other castle. She gazed at it. She smiled. She saw a girl sitting next to it. She had a hat and a doll. She looked friendly.
"Hello," Lily said. "Can I play with you?"
"Hello," the girl said. "Yes, you can. This is my castle. Do you like it?"
"I like it very much," Lily said. "It is beautiful."
"Thank you," the girl said. "Do you want to help me decorate it?"
"Yes, please," Lily said.
They took some more flowers and shells and put them on the castle. They made it more beautiful. They talked and laughed. They had fun.
Lily and Max forgot about the boy and his broken castle. They played with the girl and her pretty castle. They were happy. They made a new friend.
Tim and Tom are brothers. They like to play with their toys and eat snacks. But sometimes they fight over who gets what. One day, their mom makes meat for lunch. She puts two plates on the table, one for Tim and one for Tom.
"Here you go, boys. Eat your meat and veggies. They are good for you," mom says.
Tim and Tom run to the table. They both want the bigger piece of meat. They grab the same plate and pull.
"Let go! This is mine!" Tim shouts.
"No, it's mine! I saw it first!" Tom yells.
They tug and tug until the plate falls to the floor. The meat and veggies splatter everywhere. Mom hears the noise and comes back.
"What happened here?" mom asks. She is angry.
"Tim is selfish! He took my meat!" Tom says.
"No, Tom is selfish! He took my meat!" Tim says.
Mom shakes her head. She is disappointed.
"Boys, boys. You should share and be nice to each other. Meat is not the most important thing. Love is. Now you have no meat and no lunch. And you have to clean up this mess. I don't permit you to fight like this. Do you understand?" mom says.
Tim and Tom look at each other. They feel sorry. They nod.
"Yes, mom. We understand. We are sorry," they say.
They hug and say sorry to each other. They help mom clean up the floor. They eat some bread and cheese instead. They learn their lesson. They promise to be less selfish and more loving. Mom smiles and hugs them. She is proud.
Ben and Lily are twins. They like to play with their toys and their dog, Spot. But today, they have a task. Mom says they have to clean their room before they can go outside.
Ben and Lily look at their room. It is very messy. There are toys, books, clothes, and papers everywhere. They do not know where to start. They think the task is very difficult.
"I don't want to clean," Ben says. "Me neither," Lily says. "Can we just play?" They worry that Mom will be angry if they do not do the task.
Spot barks and wags his tail. He wants to play, too. He picks up a toy car and runs around the room. He knocks over a pile of books and makes more mess.
"Spot, no!" Ben and Lily shout. "You are making it worse!"
Mom hears the noise and comes to the room. She sees the mess and Spot with the toy car. She is not happy.
"Ben and Lily, what are you doing?" Mom asks. "You are supposed to clean your room, not make it more messy. And Spot, you are not helping. Drop the toy car, please."
Ben and Lily feel sorry. They know they have to do the task. They drop their toys and start to pick up the mess. Spot drops the toy car and sits on the bed. He looks sad.
"Mom, we are sorry," Ben and Lily say. "We will clean our room. Can we still go outside after?"
Mom smiles and hugs them. "Yes, you can go outside after you finish the task. But you have to do it well and fast. And Spot, you can go outside, too, but you have to behave. No more making messes, okay?"
Spot barks and wags his tail. He is happy. Ben and Lily are happy, too. They work together to clean their room. They think the task is not so difficult when they help each other. They finish the task and go outside with Spot. They play and have fun. They do not worry anymore.
Lily loved to read books. She had many books in her room. She liked to read about animals, and princesses, and cars. She read every day before bed.
One day, Lily saw a poster. It said there was a parade in the park. The parade had floats, and balloons, and music. Lily was eager to go. She asked her mom if they could go.
"Mom, can we go to the parade?" Lily said.
"Sorry, Lily, we can't go today. I have to work. Maybe next time," Mom said.
Lily was sad. She wanted to see the parade. She did not want to stay home. She cried.
Mom hugged Lily. She said, "I know you are sad, but I have an idea. Why don't you read a book about a parade? You can imagine you are there. You can see the floats, and the balloons, and the music in your mind."
Lily stopped crying. She thought about it. She said, "OK, Mom. I will read a book about a parade. Maybe it will be fun."
Mom smiled. She said, "Good girl. I will be back soon. I love you."
Lily went to her room. She found a book about a parade. She opened it. She saw pictures of floats, and balloons, and music. She read the words. She imagined she was there. She felt happy. She read until Mom came back.
Lily liked to go to the gym with her mom. She liked to play with the balls and the mats and the ropes. But she did not like to share with the other kids. She wanted to have all the toys for herself.
One day, a boy named Ben came to the gym with his dad. He saw Lily playing with a big red ball. He asked her if he could play with it too. Lily said no. She hugged the ball and ran away. Ben was sad. He wanted to play with the ball.
Ben was persistent. He followed Lily around the gym. He asked her again and again if he could play with the ball. Lily said no every time. She got angry. She threw the ball at Ben. It hit him in the face. He cried.
Lily's mom saw what happened. She was not happy. She told Lily to say sorry to Ben and to share the ball. Lily did not want to. She pouted. She said no.
Lily's mom had an idea. She told Lily to reverse the roles. She asked her how she would feel if Ben had the ball and did not let her play with it. She asked her how she would feel if Ben threw the ball at her. Lily thought about it. She felt bad. She realized she was not nice to Ben.
Lily went to Ben. She said sorry. She gave him the ball. She asked him if he wanted to play with her. Ben smiled. He said yes. He wiped his tears. He thanked her. They played with the ball together. They had fun.
Lily's mom was proud of Lily. She hugged her. She told her she did a good job. Lily was happy. She learned to share. She made a new friend.
Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big animal with a long neck. It is a giraffe.
"Wow, look at that!" Anna says. "It has a long, long neck. How can it eat the leaves?"
Ben says, "Maybe it can stretch its neck very high. Or maybe it can bend its neck very low. Let's go and see."
They run to the giraffe. The giraffe is friendly. It lowers its neck and lets them touch it. It feels soft and warm.
"Hello, giraffe," Anna says. "You have a nice neck. Can you tell us how you eat the leaves?"
The giraffe says, "I can eat the leaves in different ways. Sometimes I stretch my neck high and reach the top of the trees. Sometimes I bend my neck low and nibble the grass. Sometimes I eat the leaves that people give me. I like all kinds of leaves."
Anna and Ben are happy. They spend a long time with the giraffe. They give it some leaves and some water. They hug it and thank it.
"Goodbye, giraffe," they say. "We had fun with you. You are a good friend."
The giraffe says, "Goodbye, Anna and Ben. You are good friends too. Come and visit me again."
Anna and Ben wave to the giraffe. They go back to their parents. They tell them about the giraffe and its long neck. They say they want to see it again. Their parents smile and say they will.
Lena and Ben were playing in the garden. They liked to dig in the dirt and look for bugs and worms. They also liked to water the plants and watch them grow.
One day, they saw a big green ball in the dirt. They wondered what it was. They decided to dig it out and see.
"Maybe it is a toy," said Lena.
"Maybe it is a rock," said Ben.
They dug and dug until they could lift the green ball out of the dirt. It was heavy and round and had stripes on it.
They rolled it to the grass and looked at it.
"What is it?" asked Lena.
"I don't know," said Ben.
They saw a small hole on the top of the green ball. They peeked inside and saw something red and juicy.
They smelled it and it smelled sweet and fresh.
They tasted it and it tasted yummy and cool.
They smiled and laughed.
"It is a melon!" said Lena.
"It is a fruit!" said Ben.
They ate the melon and shared it with their mom and dad. They were happy and full.
They thanked the garden for giving them a surprise.
They learned a new word: reveal.
Reveal means to show something that was hidden.
The garden revealed a melon to them.
They liked to reveal new things in the garden. They thought the garden was lively and fun.
Lily and Tom were playing in the park. They saw a big pole with a sign on it. The sign said "Do not climb". Lily wanted to climb the pole. She thought it would be fun. Tom did not want to climb the pole. He thought it would be dangerous.
"Come on, Tom, let's climb the pole!" Lily said.
"No, Lily, we should not climb the pole. The sign says no. We could fall and hurt ourselves." Tom said.
Lily did not listen to Tom. She ran to the pole and grabbed it. She tried to pull herself up. But the pole was slippery and hard. She could not climb the pole. She slid down and fell on the ground. She scraped her knee and started to cry.
Tom ran to Lily and helped her up. He saw blood on her knee. He was frightened. He did not like blood. He hugged Lily and said, "I'm sorry, Lily. Are you okay?"
Lily nodded. She was sorry too. She said, "I'm sorry, Tom. You were right. I should not have climbed the pole. I was silly. Can you forgive me?"
Tom smiled. He said, "Of course I can forgive you, Lily. You are my friend. But next time, let's resist the pole, okay?"
Lily smiled back. She said, "Okay, Tom. Let's resist the pole. And let's go to the nurse and get a band-aid for my knee."
They held hands and walked to the nurse. They learned their lesson. They did not climb the pole again.
Sara loves to play with her ball. She kicks it and throws it and rolls it on the ground. She likes to make it go fast and far. Sometimes she runs after it and tries to catch it before it stops.
One day, Sara is playing with her ball in the park. She sees a big hill and thinks it would be fun to roll her ball down it. She runs to the top of the hill and pushes her ball hard. It goes very fast and very far. Sara is happy and wants to get her ball back.
She starts to run down the hill, but she does not see the big rock in her way. She trips over the rock and falls to the ground. She feels a terrible pain in her knee. She cries and cries. She wants her mommy.
Her mommy hears her cry and rushes to her. She picks her up and hugs her. She sees the blood on her knee and says, "Oh, Sara, you have a boo-boo. Let me clean it and put a band-aid on it. It will be okay."
She takes Sara to the bench and wipes her knee with a wet cloth. She puts a band-aid on it and kisses it. She says, "There, all better. Do you want to play with your ball some more?"
Sara shakes her head. She says, "No, thank you. I don't like the hill. It is too fast and too far. I want to play on the slide. It is slow and safe."
Her mommy smiles and says, "Okay, let's go to the slide. But be careful, okay?"
Sara nods and says, "Okay, mommy. I will be careful. I love you."
Her mommy says, "I love you too, Sara." They hold hands and walk to the slide. Sara forgets about her boo-boo and has fun again.
Lily and Ben were friends who liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big kangaroo near the fence. The kangaroo had a baby in her pouch. Lily and Ben wanted to see the baby, so they ran to the fence.
"Hello, kangaroo!" Lily said. "Can we see your baby?"
The kangaroo looked at them and made a loud noise. She did not like strangers near her baby. She kicked the fence with her strong legs. Lily and Ben were scared, but they did not go away.
"Come on, Ben, don't be afraid," Lily said. "We just want to say hi. Maybe the kangaroo will let us touch her baby."
Lily tried to encourage Ben, but Ben was not sure. He thought the kangaroo was angry and dangerous. He wanted to go back to the swings.
"Lily, let's go," Ben said. "The kangaroo does not want us here. She might hurt us."
But Lily was impatient. She did not listen to Ben. She climbed over the fence and walked to the kangaroo. She reached out her hand to touch the baby.
"Look, Ben, she is so cute!" Lily said.
But the kangaroo did not like Lily touching her baby. She felt Lily was a threat. She turned around and kicked Lily hard. Lily fell to the ground and cried. She was hurt and bleeding.
Ben was shocked and scared. He ran to Lily and tried to help her. He called for help. The kangaroo ran away with her baby.
Lily and Ben learned a hard lesson. They should not bother animals that do not want to be bothered. They should listen to their friends and be careful. They should not be impatient and do things that are not safe.
Lily and Tom are twins. They like to play in their room. They have many toys and books. But today they are bored. They want to do something new.
"Let's look at the roof," Tom says. He points to the window. "Maybe we can see the stars or the moon."
"Okay," Lily says. She likes stars and moon. They are shiny and pretty. She follows Tom to the window. They climb on the bed and look up.
But they do not see stars or moon. They see a big hole in the roof. They see rain and wind. They see a branch from the tree. The branch is stuck in the hole.
"Oh no!" Lily says. She is scared. She thinks the branch will fall on them. She thinks the rain will wet them. She thinks the wind will blow them away.
"Don't worry," Tom says. He is brave. He thinks the branch is fun. He thinks the rain is cool. He thinks the wind is funny. He wants to touch the branch. He reaches out his hand.
But before he can touch the branch, they hear a loud noise. They hear their mom and dad. They hear them run up the stairs. They hear them open the door.
"What are you doing?" Mom says. She is angry. She sees the hole. She sees the branch. She sees the rain and wind. She sees Lily and Tom on the bed.
"We are looking at the roof," Tom says. He smiles. He thinks mom and dad will like the roof.
Mom and dad do not like the roof. They are not happy. They are not smiling. They take Lily and Tom off the bed. They hug them and kiss them. They tell them they are safe. They tell them they are sorry. They tell them they will fix the roof.
Lily and Tom are confused. They do not understand why mom and dad are sorry. They do not understand why they need to fix the roof. They think the roof is fine. They think the roof is fun.
But they are also sleepy. They are tired from looking at the roof. They yawn and rub their eyes. They cuddle with mom and dad. They say good night to the roof. They say good night to the branch. They say good night to the rain and wind. They close their eyes and fall asleep.
Tom and Lily like to print pictures with their crayons. They have a big book with many pages of animals and plants. They choose the ones they want to print and put a paper on top of them. Then they rub the crayons on the paper and see the shapes come out.
One day, they find a page with wild animals. They see a lion, a tiger, a zebra and a giraffe. They think they are very interesting and want to print them all. They take four papers and start to print.
"Look, Lily, I have a lion!" Tom says. He shows his paper with a yellow and brown animal with a big mane.
"Wow, Tom, it is very nice!" Lily says. She shows her paper with a black and orange animal with stripes. "I have a tiger!"
They print the zebra and the giraffe too. They are happy with their pictures. They want to show them to their mom and dad.
They run to the kitchen where their mom and dad are. They hold their papers and say, "Look, look, we have wild animals!"
Their mom and dad smile and hug them. They look at their pictures and say, "They are very interesting and beautiful! You did a great job!"
Tom and Lily feel proud and happy. They like to print pictures with their crayons. They wonder what other animals and plants they can find in their big book.
Lila and Ben were playing on the beach. They liked to dig in the sand and look for shells. They found many shells of different colors and shapes. Some were big, some were small, some were smooth, some were rough.
"Look, Lila, I found a weird shell!" Ben said, holding up a shell that was round and spiky. "It has little holes in it. What do you think is inside?"
Lila looked at the shell and shrugged. "I don't know. Maybe a bug or a fish. Do you want to open it and see?"
Ben nodded. He was curious. He tried to pull the shell apart, but it was too hard. He tried to hit it with a rock, but it was too strong. He tried to poke it with a stick, but it was too sharp.
"Ow!" Ben cried, dropping the shell. "It hurt me!"
Lila ran to him and hugged him. "Are you okay, Ben? Let me see your hand."
Ben showed her his hand. It had a small cut and a drop of blood. Lila took a tissue from her pocket and wrapped it around his hand.
"It's okay, Ben. It's just a little cut. It will heal soon. Don't touch the shell anymore. It's mean."
Ben nodded. He felt better. He looked at the shell and saw something move inside. He gasped.
"Lila, look! The shell is alive! Something is coming out of it!"
Lila looked at the shell and saw a small creature with legs and claws and eyes. It was a crab. It crawled out of the shell and scuttled away.
"Wow!" Lila said. "It was a crab! It was hiding in the shell. It was scared of us. That's why it hurt you. It wanted to protect itself."
Ben nodded. He understood. He felt sorry for the crab. He wished he had not tried to open the shell.
"I'm sorry, crab," Ben said. "I didn't mean to hurt you. I hope you find a new shell. A nice one. Goodbye, crab."
Lila smiled. She took Ben's hand and they walked away. They left the shell on the sand. They hoped the crab would release it and find a new home. They learned something new that day. They learned that some shells are weird, but some shells are alive.
Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play catch with a ball. They throw the ball to each other and run and laugh.
One day, Lily brings a new toy to play with. It is a book of stamps. Lily likes stamps. They have pictures of animals and flowers and cars. Lily shows Tom her stamps. Tom thinks they are pretty.
"Can I have one?" Tom asks.
"OK, you can have one. But only one," Lily says. She gives Tom a stamp with a lion on it. Tom likes lions. He says thank you and sticks the stamp on his shirt.
They play catch with the ball again. But the ball is too fast and too hard. It hits Tom on his chest. Tom falls down and cries. The stamp falls off his shirt and flies away.
Lily runs to Tom and helps him up. She sees that his stamp is gone. She looks around and sees the stamp on the grass. She runs to get it.
But a bird sees the stamp too. It thinks it is food. It flies down and picks up the stamp with its beak. It flies away with the stamp.
Lily and Tom are sad. They lost the stamp. They watch the bird fly away.
"Bye, bye, stamp," they say. They hug each other and go home.
Lily was playing with her dolls in her room. She liked to make them talk and dress them up. She had a lot of dolls, but her favorite was Anna. Anna had long hair and a pretty dress. Lily loved Anna very much.
But Lily was also very tired. She had been playing all morning and she did not eat her snack. Her eyes felt heavy and her mouth felt dry. She wanted to nap, but she did not want to leave Anna alone. She thought Anna might be lonely or scared without her.
She decided to take Anna with her to her bed. She picked up Anna and hugged her tight. She walked to her bed and climbed on it. She pulled the blanket over them and cuddled with Anna. She whispered to Anna, "Don't worry, I will be with you. We will nap together and have sweet dreams."
But as she was falling asleep, she felt something sharp poke her arm. She opened her eyes and saw a needle sticking out of Anna's dress. She had forgotten that she had tried to sew a button on Anna's dress yesterday, but she did not finish. She had left the needle in Anna's dress and now it had hurt her.
She cried out loud and dropped Anna on the floor. She looked at her arm and saw a little drop of blood. She was scared and sad. She wanted her mommy to come and make it better.
She heard her mommy's voice from downstairs. "Lily, what's wrong? Are you okay?" Her mommy ran up the stairs and came into her room. She saw Lily on the bed, crying and holding her arm. She saw Anna on the floor, with a needle in her dress.
She quickly went to Lily and hugged her. She said, "Oh, Lily, I'm so sorry. You have a boo-boo. Let me see. It's not too bad. I will clean it and put a band-aid on it. It will heal soon. You are very brave."
She took Lily to the bathroom and washed her arm. She put a band-aid on it and kissed it. She said, "There, all done. How do you feel?"
Lily sniffled and said, "I feel better, mommy. Thank you. But I'm sorry for Anna. I hurt her with the needle. I didn't mean to. I love her."
Her mommy smiled and said, "I know, Lily. You love Anna very much. And Anna loves you too. She knows you didn't mean to hurt her. She's not mad at you. She just wants to nap with you and have sweet dreams."
She picked up Anna from the floor and took out the needle from her dress. She said, "Look, Anna is fine. She's not hurt. She's just sleepy. Why don't you take her to your bed and nap with her? I will join you in a minute. I love you, Lily."
Lily smiled and said, "I love you too, mommy. And I love Anna. Come on, Anna. Let's nap together and have sweet dreams."
She took Anna to her bed and climbed on it. She pulled the blanket over them and cuddled with Anna. She whispered to Anna, "I'm sorry, Anna. I love you. Let's nap together and have sweet dreams."
She closed her eyes and fell asleep. Her mommy came to her bed and lay down next to her. She wrapped her arms around Lily and Anna and kissed them both. She said, "Good night, my sweet girls. Nap well and have sweet dreams."
They all napped together and had sweet dreams.
Lily liked to play with her kite. She had a red kite with a long cord. She ran with the kite and made it soar in the sky. She felt happy when she saw the kite fly high and fast.
One day, she went to the park with her kite. She saw other children playing with their kites. They had different colors and shapes. Some had tails and some had bows. Lily wanted to play with them, but she was shy. She felt lonely with her red kite.
She saw a boy with a blue kite. He smiled at her and said, "Hi, I'm Ben. Do you want to play with me?"
Lily nodded and said, "Hi, I'm Lily. I like your kite."
"Thank you. I like yours too. It's very red. Can I see it?"
"Sure. Here you go."
Ben took Lily's kite and looked at it. He said, "It's very nice. Can I try it?"
"Okay. But be careful. Don't let go of the cord."
Ben ran with Lily's kite and made it soar in the sky. He said, "Wow, it's very fun. It flies very high and fast."
Lily smiled and said, "Yes, it does. I'm glad you like it."
They took turns flying each other's kites. They laughed and talked. They became friends. Lily felt happy and not lonely anymore. She liked playing with Ben and his blue kite. She liked sharing her red kite with him. She learned that kites are more fun when you have someone to play with.
Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. They saw a big dog with a cop. The dog had a yellow coat and a black nose. The cop had a blue hat and a shiny badge.
"Look, Ben, a dog!" Lily said. She was excited. She loved dogs. She wanted to pet the dog.
"Wait, Lily, we have to ask first," Ben said. He was careful. He knew some dogs could be mean. He wanted to be safe.
They ran to the cop and the dog. The cop smiled at them. The dog wagged his tail.
"Hello, kids, this is Rex. He is a police dog. He helps me catch bad guys," the cop said.
"Wow, can we pet him?" Lily asked.
"Sure, but be gentle. He is very strong and fast. He can spring and catch a ball in the air," the cop said.
He threw a ball for Rex. Rex sprang and caught it. He brought it back to the cop. Lily and Ben clapped and laughed.
"Rex is amazing! Can we play with him?" Ben asked.
"Sorry, kids, we have to go. We have work to do. But you can say bye to Rex," the cop said.
Lily and Ben hugged Rex and said bye. Rex licked their faces. The cop waved and walked away with Rex.
Lily and Ben went back to their games. They were happy. They had met a cop and a dog. They had seen Rex spring and catch a ball. They had a fun day in the park.
Tom and Lily are playing with paper. They like to fold the paper and make different shapes. Tom folds a paper into a long and thin strip. He says, "Look, Lily, I made a snake!"
Lily likes the snake. She wants to make one too. She folds a paper like Tom. But her paper is not long and thin. It is short and wide. She says, "Oh no, my snake is fat!"
Tom laughs. He says, "That's not a snake, Lily. That's a worm!" He shows her how to fold the paper again. He says, "You have to fold it like this, and this, and this."
Lily tries to fold the paper like Tom. She folds it once, twice, three times. But she still can't make it long and thin. She says, "It's too hard, Tom. I can't do it."
Tom has an idea. He says, "Don't worry, Lily. I have something to help you." He runs to his room and comes back with a button. He says, "Look, Lily, this is a button. You can use it to make your snake longer."
He gives the button to Lily. She puts it on the end of her paper. She says, "Wow, Tom, you're right. The button makes my snake longer. Thank you, Tom!"
Tom and Lily are happy. They play with their paper snakes and button. They make them slither and hiss. They have fun.
Tommy likes to record things with his toy camera. He likes to record his toys, his dog, his mom and dad, and his baby sister. He thinks it is fun to watch them later on the TV.
One day, Tommy decides to record his dad when he is taking a nap on the couch. He sneaks up to him and points his camera at his face. He presses the red button and says, "Dad, you are on TV!"
But Tommy does not know that his dad is not really sleeping. He is just pretending. He opens his eyes and makes a funny face at Tommy. He says, "Boo!"
Tommy is so surprised that he drops his camera and runs away. He is scared and embarrassed. He thinks his dad is mad at him.
But his dad is not mad. He is just playing. He picks up the camera and follows Tommy. He says, "Tommy, come back! I want to see your record. It is a funny sight. You are a good camera man."
Tommy hears his dad and stops. He turns around and sees his dad smiling. He smiles too. He is not scared or embarrassed anymore. He is happy. He runs to his dad and hugs him. He says, "Dad, you are silly. I love you."
They go to the TV and watch the record together. They laugh and have fun. Tommy thinks his dad is the best. He says, "Dad, can we record more things?"
His dad says, "Sure, Tommy. We can record anything you want. But first, let me record you. You are a wonderful sight. You are my son."
Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play with toys. One day, they find a big box in the park. The box has a lock on it.
"Wow, what is in the box?" Lily asks.
"I don't know. Maybe it is a treasure!" Ben says.
They want to open the box. But they need a key. They look around the park. They see a man with a key ring.
"Excuse me, sir. Can you help us?" Lily says.
The man is kind. He smiles and walks to them. He looks at the box and the lock.
"Sure, I can help you. Let me see if I have the right key." He says.
He tries different keys. None of them fit. He is about to give up. But then he finds a small key. He puts it in the lock. It turns. The lock opens.
"Yay, you did it!" Lily and Ben cheer.
They open the box. They see many amazing things. They see books, toys, games, and candy. They are very happy.
"Wow, this is the best box ever!" Lily says.
"Thank you, sir. You are very nice!" Ben says.
The man is happy too. He says, "You are welcome, kids. Enjoy the box. It is a gift for you. I was going to donate it to a charity, but I think you will have more fun with it."
Lily and Ben hug the man. They thank him again. They start to play with the amazing things in the box. They have a wonderful day.
Tommy was very happy when he got an invitation to Lily's birthday party. He liked Lily and wanted to play with her and the other kids. The invitation said there would be cake and games and a big surprise.
But when Tommy got to Lily's house, he saw something that made him scared. There was a big clown standing at the door, holding balloons and making funny noises. Tommy did not like clowns. He thought they were scary and mean. He wanted to run away and go home.
"Hi, Tommy!" the clown said. "Are you here for Lily's party? Come on in, I have a present for you!"
Tommy shook his head and hid behind his mom. He did not want a present from the clown. He did not want to go in.
"Tommy, don't be scared," his mom said. "The clown is just here to make you laugh. He is Lily's uncle. He is very nice. He won't hurt you. Please, give him a chance. Lily is waiting for you inside. She will be sad if you don't come."
Tommy looked at his mom and then at the clown. He saw that the clown had a friendly smile and kind eyes. He saw that the other kids were having fun with him. He saw that Lily was waving at him from the window.
Tommy took a deep breath and decided to be brave. He let go of his mom's hand and walked slowly to the clown. He took the present from him and said, "Thank you."
The clown gave him a hug and said, "You're welcome, Tommy. I'm glad you came. You're a very good boy. Now, let's go inside and have some fun!"
Tommy smiled and nodded. He followed the clown inside and joined Lily and the other kids. He had a great time at the party. He ate cake and played games and saw the big surprise. It was a magic show. Tommy liked magic. He was not scared of the clown anymore. He was happy. He was glad he came.
One day, a little pig and a little duck were playing in the mud. They liked to splash and roll and make funny noises. They did not see the farmer who was watching them from behind a fence.
The farmer was very hungry and wanted to eat the pig and the duck for his dinner. He thought they were stupid and easy to catch. He had a big net and a sharp knife. He waited for the right moment to sneak up on them.
"Hey, pig, look at me!" the duck said. "I can flap my wings and fly in the air!" The duck jumped and flapped and flew a little bit. The pig clapped his hooves and laughed.
"That's amazing, duck!" the pig said. "You are so clever and brave! I wish I could fly like you!"
The farmer saw his chance. He ran towards the pig and the duck with his net and his knife. He threw the net over the pig and grabbed the duck by the neck. The pig and the duck were scared and screamed.
"Help! Help! The farmer is here! He wants to eat us!" they cried.
But it was too late. The farmer was stronger and faster than them. He put them in a sack and took them to his house. He cooked them in a big pot and ate them for his dinner. He was very happy and full. He did not care that the pig and the duck were his friends. He was a bad and greedy farmer. The end.
One day, a farmer was working in his field. He had a big red tractor that he used to plow the soil and plant seeds. He liked his tractor very much and took good care of it.
But as he was driving his tractor, he heard a loud bang. He looked behind him and saw that one of his wheels had broken. He stopped the tractor and got off. He was very sad and worried. How could he fix his wheel? How could he finish his work?
He saw a little boy walking by the road. The boy had a blue hat and a yellow shirt. He was curious and came closer to the farmer.
"Hello, mister. What happened to your tractor?" the boy asked.
"Hello, little one. My tractor is broken. One of my wheels broke and I don't know what to do," the farmer said.
"That's too bad. Do you have a spare wheel?" the boy asked.
"No, I don't. I left it at home. And home is very far from here," the farmer said.
"Maybe I can help you. I have a bike. I can ride it to your home and bring your spare wheel back. It's not dark yet and I know the way," the boy said.
"Really? You would do that for me? That's very kind of you. Thank you, little one. You are a good friend," the farmer said.
The boy smiled and nodded. He got on his bike and rode away. The farmer waited for him and hoped he would come back soon.

Ben and Mia love to watch fireworks on New Year's Eve. They wait for the dark night and the loud bangs and the bright colors in the sky. They wear warm hats and gloves and coats, because it is very icy outside.
Before they go out, they help their dad polish the car. They use a soft cloth and a shiny spray. They rub and rub until the car looks new. They are very proud of their work. Their dad says they are good helpers.
They get in the car and drive to the park. They see many people and cars and lights. They hear music and laughter and horns. They find a good spot to see the fireworks. They get out of the car and hold their dad's hand.
They look up at the sky and wait. They count down from ten to one. Then they see the first firework. It is red and gold and makes a big star. They clap and cheer. Then they see more fireworks. They are blue and green and purple and pink. They make circles and hearts and flowers. They ooh and aah. They feel happy and excited.
They watch the fireworks for a long time. They hug their dad and wish him a happy new year. They get back in the car and drive home. They are tired and sleepy. They dream of fireworks and stars. They are glad they polished the car.
Lily liked to create things with her crayons and paper. She made pictures of flowers, animals, and her family. She was very proud of her creations and showed them to her mom and dad.
One day, she wanted to create something different. She saw her dad's bathrobe hanging in the bathroom. It was big and white and soft. Lily thought it would be fun to make it more colorful. She took her crayons and started to draw on the bathrobe. She made circles, stars, and hearts. She smiled as she saw how pretty it looked.
She ran to the living room to show her dad. "Look, dad, I created a new bathrobe for you!" she said, holding up the robe.
Dad was not happy. He saw the crayon marks all over his bathrobe. He was angry and sad. He liked his bathrobe the way it was. He did not want it to be ruined. He yelled at Lily. "Lily, what did you do? You ruined my bathrobe! This is not creating, this is destroying! Go to your room right now!"
Lily was scared and confused. She did not mean to make dad angry. She thought he would like her creation. She started to cry. She said, "I'm sorry, dad, I just wanted to make you happy."
Dad did not listen. He was too mad. He took the bathrobe and threw it in the trash. He told Lily to go to her room and not come out until he said so.
Lily ran to her room, sobbing. She felt bad and lonely. She wished dad was more polite and understood her. She wished she never touched the bathrobe. She wished she could create something that would make dad happy.
Sam and Mia are playing in the park. They like to run and slide and swing. They see a big black truck with a picture of a rhinoceros on it. They are curious and want to see the rhinoceros.
"Look, Mia, a rhinoceros!" Sam says. "Let's go and say hello."
"OK, Sam, but be careful. Rhinoceroses are big and strong and have horns," Mia says.
They run to the truck and peek inside. They see a big black rhinoceros lying on the floor. He looks sad and tired. He has a chain around his neck.
"Hello, rhinoceros," Sam says. "Why are you in the truck? Do you want to play with us?"
The rhinoceros does not answer. He just sighs and closes his eyes.
"Maybe he is sick or hurt," Mia says. "We should help him."
She finds a pair of scissors on the ground and tries to cut the chain. Sam helps her. They are almost done when they hear a loud voice.
"Hey, you kids, get away from there!" the voice says. "That's my rhinoceros and he's not for playing. He's for the circus."
They look up and see a mean man with a whip and a hat. He is angry and runs to the truck.
"Uh-oh, we have to go," Sam says. "Come on, Mia, run!"
But it is too late. The mean man grabs them and throws them in the truck. He locks the door and drives away.
"Help, help!" Sam and Mia cry. "Let us out!"
But no one hears them. They are stuck in the truck with the rhinoceros. They are scared and sad. They wish they never saw the rhinoceros. They wish they stayed in the park. They don't know what will happen to them. The end.
Lily and Ben are in the car with Mom. They are going to the park. But there is a lot of traffic on the road. The cars are moving very slowly. Lily and Ben are bored.
"Mom, why are there so many cars?" Lily asks.

"Let's play count the cars. We can take turns to count how many cars we see of each color. I start with red. One, two, three, four, five red cars!" Ben says.

"Bang, bang, you're dead, robber!" Sam shouted, pointing his pistol at Ben.
"No, I'm not, cowboy! You missed me!" Ben said, running away with his bag.
Sam followed him, but he saw a big dog on the grass. The dog was black and brown, and had wide ears and a long tail. Sam liked dogs, and he wanted to pet it. He forgot about Ben and the game, and ran towards the dog.
"Hey, Sam, where are you going?" Ben called, looking back. "The game is not over!"
But Sam ignored him. He reached the dog and knelt down to stroke its fur. The dog wagged its tail and licked Sam's face. Sam laughed and hugged the dog.
"Hello, doggy, you're so nice and soft!" Sam said.
The dog's owner, a lady with a red coat and a hat, came over and smiled.
"Hello, little boy, what's your name?" she asked.
"I'm Sam, and this is my pistol," Sam said, showing her his toy gun.
The lady looked surprised and a bit scared.
"Oh, I see. Well, that's a very...interesting pistol. But you know, you shouldn't point it at people or animals, right? It's not polite, and it could be dangerous," she said.
Sam nodded. He didn't want to hurt anyone, he just wanted to play.
"OK, I'm sorry. I won't point it anymore," he said.
"That's good. And what about your friend over there? He looks lonely. Don't you want to play with him?" the lady asked, pointing at Ben, who was still waiting by the swings.
Sam looked at Ben and felt bad. He had ignored him, and that was not nice. He wanted to be a good friend.
"Yes, I do. Come on, doggy, let's go play with Ben!" he said, getting up and running back to Ben.
The dog followed him, barking happily. Ben smiled and waved at Sam.
"Hi, Sam, I'm glad you're back. Do you want to play some more?" he asked.
"Yes, I do. And look, I have a new friend. This is doggy, and he's very friendly. Can he play with us?" Sam asked.
Ben looked at the dog and nodded.
"Sure, he can. He's a cute dog. Maybe he can be the sheriff, and we can be his deputies," he suggested.
Sam liked the idea. He gave his pistol to the dog, who held it in his mouth.
"OK, doggy, you're the sheriff. And we're your deputies. Let's go catch some robbers!" he said.
The three of them ran around the park, having fun and making noise. The lady watched them and smiled. She was glad they were happy and safe. She hoped they would always be friends.

John knelt down and started to examine the tree carefully. He saw something shiny and reached out to touch it. It was a knife! He picked it up and started to feel excited about his discovery.
John heard footsteps nearby and jumped to his feet. He saw his mother walking towards him with a worried look on her face.
"John, what are you doing? You shouldn't be out here in the woods alone," said his mother.
John held out the knife towards his mom and said, "Look Mommy, I found a knife!"
His mother looked at the knife and shook her head in disapproval. 
"No, John. That's very dangerous. You should put it down and come with me," she said.
John frowned and put the knife down. He wanted to keep it and thought his mom was being mean. He kicked the ground and said, "But why?"
His mother kneeled down and said, "I love you, John. I support you, but sometimes I have to make sure you are safe. This knife is too sharp and would be dangerous for a small child like you."
John nodded his head as his mother took his hand. Together they walked back home
Katie was walking in the park when she met a bald man. She noticed his head was very shiny without any hair. She asked the man what he was doing.
"I'm spreading butter on my wheels," he said.
Katie was very interested. She asked what the wheels were for.
"I'm making a big wheel cake," he said. "It will look like a giant wheel and I'm going to put butter on each layer of the cake."
Katie thought it sounded delicious. She asked if she could help spread the butter. The bald man said yes.
So Katie and the bald man spread the butter on the wheels. They took their time and made sure each layer of the cake was evenly covered. When it was finished, the bald man smiled and said it was ready for the oven.
Katie watched as the bald man put the wheel cake into the oven and she couldn't wait to see what it would look like when it was finished. She knew it was going to be delicious.

Alice stepped away from the window for a moment, then she started to remember. She had left a piece of cheese outside for the pick! She had known all along that the Pick would eventually come!
Alice was excited, but also a little scared. She didn’t know if the Pick would be friendly or not. She slowly made her way to the window and peeked out. The Pick was still there, looking right at her. Then, it reached out its long beak and snapped up the piece of cheese!
Alice smiled. She was happy that the Pick had come and that everything was organized in her room. She knew that she could trust the Pick to visit her every day!

John sat on the furniture. His mom put him there to be quiet. He was bored, so he decided to explore. He saw something dull and brown. He was curious about why it was here and what it was. He asked his mom, "What is this?"
His mom replied, "That's my chair. Don't touch it. It's very dull."
John began to get frustrated. He wanted to explore, but his mom wouldn't let him. "Why can't I touch it?" he asked.
His mom put her hand on his shoulder and said, "It might not look like much, but it's very special to me. It belonged to your grandfather."
John was amazed. He sat there and thought about his grandfather and all the stories he heard about him. He knew he had to be careful with the furniture, so he gently touched it. He was glad his mom had let him explore after all.

One day, they were walking on a beach when they saw a palm tree. John wanted to climb the tree, so he took off his dress and put it down on the sand. Sam couldn't resist the temptation. He quickly put on John's dress and went to the palm tree.
When Sam got to the top, he saw that there was a delicious fruit. He wanted to take it, but then he saw how sad John looked down below. He remembered how he had stolen John's dress, so he knew it would be wrong to take the fruit. He quickly got down the tree and gave the dress back to John. John was so glad he had his dress back that he picked the fruit and shared it with Sam.
They enjoyed the delicious fruit, but more importantly, Sam learned an important lesson. He realised that it was better to be honest and generous, rather than taking what wasn't rightfully yours.
Little Farleigh was walking along the sidewalk on a sunny day, looking from side to side at the sights as she went. She watched birds flying in the sky, admired flowers blooming in the garden, and delighted at the funny faces of passersby. 
Suddenly, she heard a voice calling out from behind a tall tree: "Hello there! Can you help me? I am too tired to move." 
Startled, Farleigh took a step back - she had not expected to encounter a talking tree. But the tree seemed friendly, so she decided to approach it. From behind the tree's large trunk walked out a little rabbit, who looked even more tired than the tree. 
Farleigh was filled with curiosity, but also a bit of fear. She asked the rabbit hesitantly, "what happened?" Without a trace of fear the little rabbit replied, "I was playing hide and seek with my friends. We were so busy having fun, we lost track of time. Now I can't find them, and I am too tired to go look for them."

Days later, Farleigh and her new friends found all the hidden rabbits and celebrated with a big feast. Everyone was very happy that she

The two children followed their dad into the yard and watched him pick up a fork. "We're going to use this fork to bury something," he said.
The children watched curiously as dad began to dig a hole in the ground. He was quiet and focused on his task. The children waited patiently. Finally, dad finished digging the hole.
He turned to the children and said, "Now it's time to put something in the hole and bury it." The two children didn't move. They were confused. 
Dad then took a big can out of the house and said, "This can is full of our important things. We're going to bury it in the ground so no one can take it." 
The children were sad. They thought it was wrong to bury the can. Dad didn't care what they thought. He put the can in the hole and began to fill it with dirt.

One day, his farmer had an idea. He thought it would be better if Max helped on the farm, instead of just eating the grass. So he decided to replace Max with a tractor. 
Max was sad. He liked eating grass and didn't want to go. He begged and pleaded with the farmer, saying, "Please don't replace me! I can help you on the farm!" 
But the farmer didn't listen. He said, "I'm sorry, Max. But I need a tractor to help me with the farm more than I need a cow."
Max was angry and he ran away. He ended up in a nearby town, far away from his old farm. Without the farmer and the farm, Max knew he wouldn't survive.

The moral of the story is that even when you are small and seem powerless, you can still find a way to help others.
Once there was a little girl called Mari who lived with her mom in a cozy house. She was very cheerful and often played in her garden. One day, there was a sound coming from the garden and Mari went to investigate.
When she got there, Mari saw a little puddle of water! She came closer and saw that it was a leak from the side of the house. She ran to her mom and said, "Mommy, there's a leak in the garden!"
Mari's mom went outside with her and saw that there was a leak from the water pipe in the wall. She was not worried, however, and said, "Let's fix this! It will be a fun task!"
Mari and her mom went to the store to buy a little tool to fix the leak. Mari was so happy and cheerful to have a task with her mom. After they bought the tool, they went home to fix the leak.
It took Mari and her mom a few tries to fix the leak, but after a while the leak was fixed! Mari was so proud of herself and cheerfully said, "Mom, I fixed the leak!" Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, you did! Great job!"
Amy and Jack were washing the car together. All was going well until Jack took a strip off the sponge. Amy wanted to keep it tidy. She refused to let Jack use the strip, so a fight broke out.
Jack wanted to use the strip to help wash the car. However, Amy wanted him to leave it alone and said he was making a mess.
Jack refused and they argued and argued. Then Amy came up with the perfect solution. She said that Jack could use the strip to serve her. This would both tidy the car and make them both happy.
Jack agreed, and together they worked to serve the car with the strip, and soon enough it was clean and tidy.
Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Jazz. She loved the mild wind that blew through the trees. In the warm summer evenings, she sat in her garden and listened to the calm whispers of nature.
One day, Jazz was in the garden, listening to the sweet whisper of the birds as they flew by. Suddenly, there was a sound of beautiful music in the air. Jazz looked around, watching as the trees started to move.
She crept closer and saw a small band playing their instruments. The gentle music filled the air and the trees swayed with the rhythm. Jazz giggled and clapped her hands in delight.
The band noticed her and smiled. "Come join us, little one!" the leader of the band said with a kind voice. Jazz nodded and slowly stepped forward, her heart beating with excitement.
The band began to play a gentle jazz tune. Jazz smiled and started to whisper the words of the song. She felt so happy and free. As the light faded, the band slowly stopped playing and Jazz thanked them with a smile before she went back inside.
Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lily. She was out exploring in the woods when she spotted something on the ground. She looked closer and saw that it was a skull! She was scared and upset. She ran back home as fast as her tiny legs could carry her. 
When she got home, Lily told her mom about the skull. Her mom said it was probably from an animal, but Lily didn't feel better. She was still scared and upset so her mom hugged her and said that everything was going to be ok.
But Lily was still worried, so her mom asked her if they should go back and take a look. That way, Lily could see if anything bad was happening. She agreed, so they put on their shoes and went back to the woods.
When they arrived, Lily looked around to make sure everything was ok. She didn't see anything scary and soon she felt better. She even smiled when she saw how the sun was shining through the trees. It was a beautiful day!
Lily and her mom continued to explore the woods, until they had to go home. Lily said goodbye to her skull friend, feeling much better than when she had arrived.
One day, a large velvet chair appeared on the porch. All the children in the neighbourhood were curious to find out who the chair belonged to.
The kids started to whisper to each other. "I think it's for me" one said.
They all went up to the chair and started to feel how soft it was. Suddenly, a voice boomed from upstairs.
"Who said you could touch my chair?”
The children froze, not sure what to do.
An old lady stepped onto the porch and smiled at them. “It’s for all of you to enjoy,” she said.
The children cheered with delight. Every day they spent happy hours playing on the large velvet chair.  It was the favourite spot in all of the neighbourhood.
Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sam. She wanted to find something exciting to do, so she decided to explore beyond her home. As she was walking, she came across a big mailbox. Sam had never seen it before and it seemed very mysterious - she had never seen a mailbox so big and without a familiar house around it. 
Curious, she decided to take a closer look. As she walked closer and closer to the mailbox she heard a voice coming from inside the box.
"Help me! Help me!" the voice cried out. Sam was scared and didn't know what to do. 
"Hello?" she replied. "Who's in there?".
A cheerful voice replied, "My name is Wally and I'm stuck in here! Please help me get out". 
Sam smiled and asked, "What should I do?".
"Can you open the door?" Wally asked.
Happily, Sam opened the door and Wally stepped out. Sam and Wally hugged and thanked each other for being so brave.
This experience taught Sam an important lesson - you can never be too afraid to help someone in need, even if it seems scary or unknown.
Susie was happy. She went to the cold field with her mom. The sun was shining, the wind was whispers around them.
"What are we going to do here mom?" asked Susie.
"We are going to use this field. We will pick some flowers," her mom said.
Susie looked around and saw that there were no flowers in the field. "Where are the flowers mom?"
"The flowers might not bloom yet, it's still too cold. We just have to wait," said her mom.
Susie was disappointed. She wanted to find some flowers now. But she saw her mom was sad too.
Susie had an idea. She gave her mom a hug and said, "Let's pick some grass. We can use it for something later."
